	abstract = {It can be argued that anti-immigrant policies, such as the 287(g) program, can have a direct impact on the health and well-being of the immigrant community in general, particularly undocumented immigrants in the United States. While there is yet to be a comprehensive and conclusive empirical assessment of this issue, what is known is that the immigrant community faces many stress factors and structural barriers that negatively impact health. We argue that it is urgent that public health responds to the unique experiences and challenges of the undocumented and wider immigrant community. In doing so, we propose three recommendations for addressing this issue: (1) Assess the causal relationship between anti-immigration policies and immigrant health, (2) Increase funding and access to health care services for immigrant communities in jurisdictions implementing anti-immigrant policies, and (3) For public health to engage in a conscious effort to service the undocumented immigrant community. Even though we focus specifically on the United States, our recommendations are applicable on a global scale since anti-immigration policies are prevalent across nations and are a pervasive human rights issue around the world.},

	abstract = {As immigration and health policy continue to be contentious topics globally, anthropologists must examine how policy creates notions of health-related deservingness, which may have broad consequences. This paper explores hidden relationships between immigration enforcement laws and the most recent health reform law in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which excludes immigrants from certain types of health services. Findings in this paper show how increasingly harsh immigration enforcement efforts provide health facilities a 'license to discriminate' against undocumented immigrants, resulting in some facilities 'dumping' undocumented patients or unlawfully transferring them from one hospital to another. Due to changes made through the ACA, patient dumping disproportionately complicates public hospitals' financial viability and may have consequences on public facilities' ability to provide care for all indigent patients. By focusing on the converging consequences of immigrant policing and health reform, findings in this paper ultimately show that examining deservingness assessments and how they become codified into legislation, which I call 'deservingness projects', can reveal broader elements of state power and demonstrate how such power extends beyond targeted populations. Exercises of state power can thus have 'spillover effects' that harm numerous vulnerable populations, highlighting the importance of medical anthropology in documenting the broad, hidden consequences of governmental actions that construct populations as undeserving of social services.},

	abstract = {Objectives: 
          We examined changes in health care access and utilization associated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) for different Asian American subgroups relative to non-Latino whites (whites).
          Research Design: 
          Using 2003–2017 California Health Interview Survey data, we examined changes in 4 health care access measures and 2 utilization measures among whites and 7 Asian American subgroups. We estimated the unadjusted and adjusted percentage point changes on the absolute scale from the pre-ACA to post-ACA periods. Adjusted estimates were obtained from multivariable logistic regression models that controlled for predisposing, enabling, and need factors. We also estimated the pre-ACA to post-ACA changes between whites and Asian American subgroups using a difference-in-difference approach.
          Results: 
          After the ACA was implemented, uninsurance decreased among all Asian American subgroups, but improvements in disparities relative to whites in these measures were limited. In particular, Koreans had the largest absolute reduction in uninsurance (−16.8 percentage points) and were the only subgroup with a significant reduction in terms of disparities relative to whites (−10.1 percentage points). However, little or no improvement was observed in the other 3 access measures (having a usual source of care, delayed medical care in past year, or delayed prescription drug use in past year) and 2 utilization measures (having a physician visit or emergency department visit in past year).
          Conclusions: 
          Despite coverage gains among Asian American subgroups, especially Koreans, disparities in access and utilization persisted across all Asian American subgroups.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Latino youth experience worse access to and utilization of health care compared with non-Latino "white" youth, with inequities persisting following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). To better understand these disparities, we examine changes in youth's access and utilization associated with the ACA for different Latino heritage groups relative to whites.
STUDY DESIGN: We use 6 years (2011-2016) of National Health Interview Survey data to examine Latino youth's insurance coverage and health care utilization by heritage group, nativity, and parental language. The dependent measures of utilization included well-child, emergency department, and physician visits. We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the odds of each dependent measure and interacted heritage group and time period [2011-2013 (pre-ACA) versus 2014-2016 (post-ACA)] to examine how changes associated with the ACA varied by group.
RESULTS: Insurance coverage and well-child visits improved among youth overall following implementation of the ACA. Although Mexican and Central or South American youth experienced the largest absolute increase in coverage, they still had high levels of uninsurance post-ACA (9.9\% and 9.1\%, respectively). Disparities in coverage between Puerto Rican and white youth improved, while disparities in well-child visits between Mexican and white youth worsened. Little to no movement was observed in disparities by nativity and parental language.
CONCLUSIONS: Most disparities in insurance and utilization across Latino heritage groups and white youth persisted post-ACA despite significant gains within groups. Although disparities for Puerto Rican youth have improved, Mexican and Central or South American youth continue to experience disparities.},

Methods. Insurance status and enrollment experiences came from the Minnesota Health Insurance Transitions Study (MH-HITS), a follow-up telephone survey of children and adults in Minnesota who had no health insurance in the fall of 2013.

Results. ACA had a tempered success in Minnesota. Outreach and enrollment efforts were effective; one half of those previously uninsured gained coverage, although many reported difficulty signing up (nearly 62\%). Of the previously uninsured who gained coverage, 44\% obtained their coverage through MNsure, Minnesota’s insurance marketplace. Most of those who remained uninsured heard of MNsure and went to the Web site. Many still struggled with the enrollment process or reported being deterred by the cost of coverage.

Conclusions. Targeting outreach, simplifying the enrollment process, focusing on affordability, and continuing funding for in-person assistance will be important in the future.},

DATA SOURCES: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, State Physicians Workforce Data Book, and Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2013 and 2015.
STUDY DESIGN: Quasi-experimental design with difference-in-differences analyses. Outcomes included health insurance coverage, having personal doctor(s), being unable to see doctors because of cost, and receiving a flu shot. We tested racial/ethnic differential impacts using the "Seemingly unrelated estimation" method. Multiple imputations and survey weights were used.
DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Low-income, nonelderly adults were identified based on age, household income, and family size.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among the low-income, nonelderly adults, Medicaid expansion was associated with statistically significant gains in health insurance coverage, having personal doctors, and affordability. Hispanics got the fewest benefits, which significantly widened racial/ethnic disparities for the Hispanic group. Racial/ethnic disparity in having personal doctors narrowed for non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic others, although not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Medicaid expansion improved access to primary care, but it had differential effects among racial/ethnic groups resulting in mixed effects on disparities. Further research is necessary to develop tailored policy tools for racial/ethnic groups.},

To explore the distributional effects of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) expansion of health benefits and the resulting income inequality, this study used alternative income measures that incorporate the value of the ACA’s health insurance changes under the law. The study simulated the impact of the ACA on income inequality in 2019 compared with a scenario without the ACA. We found that the ACA reduced income inequality and that the decrease was much larger in states that expanded Medicaid than in states that did not. We also decomposed the effect of the ACA on inequality by race/ethnicity, age, and family educational attainment. The ACA reduced inequality both across groups and within these groups. With efforts to repeal the ACA—specifically, California v. Texas—having shifted from Congress to the courts, it remains important to consider the consequences of fully repealing the ACA, which would likely reverse reduced inequality observed under the law.},

Using a combined-sample multiple imputation (CSMI) approach, we leverage the large sample of the American Community Survey (ACS) and impute migration status using the 2008 and 2014 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the only nationally representative survey to include any proxies for migration status. Multivariate difference-in-differences models suggest that Medicaid expansion increased the odds of Medicaid coverage among eligible immigrants. Medicaid expansion, however, was not associated with changes in Medicaid coverage rates for non-Lawful Permanent Residents (non-LPRs, a group that consists overwhelmingly of unauthorized immigrants). Disparities in Medicaid coverage persist across migration status groups following the ACA, particularly as the unauthorized remain excluded from expansion, subsidies, and the ACA marketplace.

            We use large-scale federal survey data linked to administrative death records to investigate the relationship between Medicaid enrollment and mortality. Our analysis compares changes in mortality for near-elderly adults in states with and without Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions. We identify adults most likely to benefit using survey information on socioeconomic status, citizenship status, and public program participation. We find that prior to the ACA expansions, mortality rates across expansion and nonexpansion states trended similarly, but beginning in the first year of the policy, there were significant reductions in mortality in states that opted to expand relative to nonexpanders. Individuals in expansion states experienced a 0.132 percentage point decline in annual mortality, a 9.4\% reduction over the sample mean, as a result of the Medicaid expansions. The effect is driven by a reduction in disease-related deaths and grows over time. A variety of alternative specifications, methods of inference, placebo tests, and sample definitions confirm our main result.},

This paper estimates the causal effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage in 2014 using data from the American Community Survey. We utilize difference-in-difference-in-differences models that exploit cross-sectional variation in the intensity of treatment arising from state participation in the Medicaid expansion and local area pre-ACA uninsured rates. This strategy allows us to identify the effects of the ACA in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. Our preferred specification suggests that, at the average pre-treatment uninsured rate, the full ACA increased the proportion of residents with insurance by 5.9 percentage points compared to 2.8 percentage points in states that did not expand Medicaid. Private insurance expansions from the ACA were due to increases in both employer-provided and non-group coverage. The coverage gains from the full ACA were largest for those without a college degree, non-whites, young adults, unmarried individuals, and those without children in the home. We find no evidence that the Medicaid expansion crowded out private coverage.},

	doi = {10.1097/DCR.0000000000001260},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: 
        Colorectal cancer screening decreases incidence and improves survival. Minorities and low-income patients have lower screening rates. The Affordable Care Act increased insurance coverage for low-income Americans by funding Medicaid expansion. Not all states expanded Medicaid. The effect of Medicaid expansion on colorectal cancer screening is unknown.
        OBJECTIVE: 
        This study aimed to evaluate if Medicaid expansion improved colorectal cancer screening for minorities and low-income patients.
        DESIGN: 
        We used the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, a nationally representative health-related telephone survey, to compare colorectal cancer screening rates from 2012 to 2016 based on Medicaid expansion status. A difference-in-difference analysis was used to compare the trends.
        SETTINGS: 
        All states were included in this survey.
        PATIENTS: 
        Respondents aged 50 to 64 from the early expansion, 2014 expansion, and nonexpansion states were selected.
        INTERVENTIONS: 
        Medicaid expansion was funded by the Affordable Care Act.
        MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
        The primary outcome measured was the screening rate based on US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.
        RESULTS: 
        Overall screening in expansion states increased (early, +4.5\%, p {\textless} 0.001; 2014, +1.3\%, p = 0.17) compared with nonexpansion states. Screening among low-income respondents increased in early expansion states (+5.7\%; p = 0.003), whereas there was no change in 2014 expansion states compared with nonexpansion states (2014, –0.3\%, p = 0.89). For blacks, there was a significant increase in early expansion states, but no change in 2014 expansion states (early, +8.1\%, p = 0.045; 2014, –1.5\%, p = 0.64). There was no significant change for Hispanic respondents in early or 2014 expansion states compared with nonexpansion states (early, +6.5\%, p = 0.11; 2014, +1.2\%, p = 0.77).
        LIMITATIONS: 
        Survey data are subject to response and recall bias. Factors other than Medicaid expansion may have influenced the screening rate.
        CONCLUSIONS: 
        The colorectal cancer screening rate has increased in all settings, but expansion accelerated the increases in early expansion states and among low-income and black respondents; however, there was no similar increase for Hispanic respondents. It will be important to continue to monitor the effects of Medicaid expansion on colorectal cancer care, especially the incidence by stage and mortality.

The percentage of uninsured noncitizens decreased from 69.6 percent in 2010 to 53.5 percent in 2015. However, uninsurance rates remained high for noncitizens in 2015, with 44.9 percent of them uninsured in expansion states, compared to 16.3 percent of natives. A triple-differences analysis suggested that among natives and noncitizens, 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively, of the drop in uninsurance were attributable to Medicaid expansion. However, decreases in uninsurance among naturalized citizens could not be attributed to Medicaid expansion. Although health insurance coverage improved significantly for natives, naturalized citizens, and noncitizens, substantial disparities in insurance coverage persisted for noncitizen immigrants.},

	abstract = {Background
More than 30 states have either expanded Medicaid or are actively considering expansion. The coverage gains from this policy are well documented, however, the impacts of its increasing coverage on poverty disparity are unclear at the national level.

Method
American Community Survey (2012–2018) was used to examine the effects of Medicaid expansion on poverty disparity in insurance coverage for nonelderly adults in the United States. Differences-in-differences-in-differences design was used to analyze trends in uninsured rates by poverty levels: (1) {\textless} 138 \%, (2) 138–400 \% and (3) {\textgreater} 400 \% federal poverty level (FPL).

Results
Compared with uninsured rates in 2012, uninsured rates in 2018 decreased by 10.75 \%, 6.42 \%, and 1.11 \% for {\textless} 138 \%, 138–400 \%, and {\textgreater} 400 \% FPL, respectively. From 2012 to 2018, {\textgreater} 400 \% FPL group continuously had the lowest uninsured rate and {\textless} 138 \% FPL group had the highest uninsured rate. Compared with ≥ 138 \% FPL groups, there was a 2.54 \% reduction in uninsured risk after Medicaid expansion among {\textless} 138 \% FPL group in Medicaid expansion states versus control states. After eliminating the impact of the ACA market exchange premium subsidy, 3.18 \% decrease was estimated.

Conclusion
Poverty disparity in uninsured rates improved with Medicaid expansion. However, {\textless} 138 \% FPL population are still at a higher risk for being uninsured.},

	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays in the area of Economics of Education. In Chapter 2, I examine the effects of for-profit institution closures following the 2014 gainful employment policy to understand how for-profit institutions impact outcomes for potential students. I use data on degree granting Title IV postsecondary education institutions from 2010 to 2019. I combine this institution information with data on student enrollment and debt at the county level as well as educational attainment at the Public Use Microdata Area level. The closing of for-profit institutions leads to a 4.5 percent decline in the number of enrolled students in counties that experienced closings, with the largest impacts on African-American and Hispanic students. However, for-profit institutions closures have a relatively small effect on educational attainment. Furthermore, the amount of student debt declines substantially, indicating for-profit institution closures produce sustained improvements in student debts.
In Chapter 3, I estimate the intergenerational effect of parents education on children’s criminal behavior using data from PSID. With the historical changes of compulsory schooling laws applied to the parent’s generation, which affects children’s crime only through parental education, I examine whether education has a causal intergenerational effect in crime reduction. From my empirical analysis, I find that an additional year of mother’s education decreases the probability of her child being arrested by 9.9 percentage points, and the probability of her child being on probation by 8.3 percentage points. This result suggests that the social return of education in terms of crime reduction is substantially underestimated without taking into account this long-term effect.
In Chapter 4, I study the effects of entry labor market conditions and break down the mechanism by using NLSY97. Using variation in the employment in the fields of study-cohort level, I find that cohorts experience a 5 percent increase in earnings on average during the first ten years in the labor market in response to a one-percentage-point growth in the employment level. I show that these earning gains due to the labor market condition in the year of entry can be explained by a decrease in the probability of working in an industry less matched to their skills and the switching behaviors.},

	abstract = {In the last few decades, we have witnessed rapid and enormous changes in labor demands. The rapid spread of computers in workplaces induces firms to replace tasks previously performed by unskilled workers, exacerbating inequality. The rising Chinese import competition causes unemployment in the manufacturing sector of the major trading partners. These shocks, which I call labor demand shocks, induce structural changes in the production side of firms and the labor market. I conduct micro-level causal inference on these labor demand shocks and provide solid empirical knowledge on how the economy works at a more disaggregated level and reasonable estimates of underlying structural parameters.
In the first chapter, I study how capital investment affects labor demand in the automation process at the firm level. Using the bonus depreciation policy in the recent U.S. tax reform as an exogenous variation in capital cost, I find that the policy-driven reduction in capital cost lowers labor demand while raising capital expenditure for machinery and equipment. Using detailed information on skill and patent compositions at the firm level, I also report that the reduction in labor demand concentrates on routine cognitive jobs and firms with high automation-related technologies, supporting the displacement effect of automation.
The second chapter evaluates the impact of high-tech clusters on inequalities in labor demand and regional development by focusing on a Chinese placed-based industrial policy called “Made in China 2025.” Exploiting the staggered roll-out of the policy across pilot cities and representative online job posting data, we conduct an event-study analysis to investigate the effects of high-tech clusters on job openings and wages across occupations and regions. We find that the policy leads to a significant increase in labor demand in pilot cities with a widening wage gap between routine and non-routine occupations, while lowering it in neighboring areas of the pilot cities.
The last chapter examines how the labor market effects of import competition vary across Black, Hispanic, and white populations. For a given level of exposure to imports from China, we find no evidence that minority workers are relatively more harmed than white workers in their manufacturing employment. However, Hispanic workers are overrepresented in exposed industries and therefore face greater manufacturing employment losses. In addition, they experienced relative losses in non-manufacturing employment. In contrast, Black workers are less likely to live in areas or work in industries facing import competition, resulting in less harmful effects on manufacturing employment. In addition, exposed Black workers experienced gains in non-manufacturing and overall employment with no measurable wage consequences.},

	abstract = {My dissertation comprises three chapters. The first chapter examines the impact of Amazon’s physical expansion on local business owners, finding no effect on income but an increase in full-time local business owners. The second chapter assesses the effects of e-commerce expansion on the US labor market using instrumental variable techniques to analyze earnings, employment, and establishment numbers. The third chapter studies implementation of Recreational Marijuana Legalization (RML), finding no significant impact on labor outcomes across different skill levels.
The first chapter examines the impacts of the Amazon expansion on US business owners. Amazon’s enabling of third-party sellers on its platform gave the company a strong foothold in the e-commerce market, allowing it to expand its physical presence across the United States. This paper examines how the gradual physical expansion of Amazon has affected local independent business owners on the county level outcome. I take natural instrumental variables to approach solving the endogeneity problem, which comes up as a result of taking care of the timing and location issues before setting up the fulfillment center. Using Current Population Survey (CPS) ASEC data from 2000-2021 this paper suggests that closer proximity to a fulfillment center has no predictive power on the income of full-time business owners. On the other hand, this research shows that by bolstering the physical presence across the United States at the county level, amazon motivates previously employed people to be full-time local business owners. Further empirical research using U.S. patent data reveals that the diffusion of e-commerce has no discernible impact on the innovative capacity of either incorporated or non-incorporated firms.
In the second chapter, I empirically test how e-commerce expansion has been impacting US labor market. E-commerce has experienced a remarkable surge in recent years, with top companies dominating the market and generating a significant share of total sales. While e-commerce has undoubtedly brought numerous benefits to consumers and businesses alike, it has also raised concerns about its impact on the labor market. The retail industry represents a significant portion of the total workforce in the US, and the rapid expansion of e-commerce has led to questions about the extent to which it has contributed to local labor markets. Moreover, the adoption of automated fulfillment centers by e-commerce companies such as Amazon has raised concerns about the potential negative spillover effects on other industries. To address the potential endogeneity of Amazon’s entry, I employ a rigorous instrumental variable (IV) approach, constructing multiple instruments based on existing literature. In this paper, I aim to address these concerns and explore the impact of physical expansion of e-commerce setups on the local labor force. My analysis focuses on three key outcome variables: earnings, employment, and the number of establishments. By utilizing these IV techniques, I aim to provide robust estimates of the causal effects of Amazon’s presence on the local labor market dynamics.
In the third chapter, my study aims to examine the variation in the implementation of Recreational Marijuana Legalization (RML) across different states, utilizing the CPS Basic Monthly Sample data from 2009 to 2021. Employing a rigorous econometric approach, the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression method is employed to estimate the impact of RML on various labor outcomes, accounting for time-varying treatment effects and dynamic effects in states where it has been legalized for an extended period. Prior research provide suggestive and statistically significant evidence that high-skill service workers are less likely to face pre- or post-employment drug screening following the implementation of RML. Additionally, considering the income effect theory and the potential vulnerability of mid-skill workers who lack access to public insurance, this study investigates the impact of RML on their earnings and productivity. By categorizing workers based on their skill levels, the analysis reveals no significant impact on labor outcomes for individuals with high, mid, and low skill levels when employing recently developed DiD estimation methods that account for staggered timing and treatment heterogeneity. This finding starkly contradicts the results obtained through conventional Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) method.},

	abstract = {This dissertation consists of one chapter in labor economics and two chapters on immigration.
Chapter 1 examines the importance of school alumni networks for labor-market outcomes. Specifically, I use LinkedIn public profile data to study the influence of vertical connections (i.e., the relationships between senior and junior workers who are connected through sharing the same alma mater) on hirings and promotions. Taking the law sector as a case study relying on an event-study design and an exposure framework, I find that having a senior worker who shares the same alma mater as a junior worker not only increases the junior worker’s chances to be hired by the firm, especially at small-size firms, but also makes the junior worker more likely to be internally promoted. Investigations into the mechanisms suggest that the homophily channel may be at play for both hiring and promotions, but the information channel appears more important for promotions.
Chapter 2 investigates the spillover effects of a U.S. immigration enforcement policy, "Secure Communities," on the health status and the demand for health-care of Hispanic U.S. citizens, that is, individuals who are not directly targeted by the policy but are nonetheless culturally linked to unauthorized immigrants. By exploiting the staggered rollout of the policy within an event-study and a triple-difference framework, I find that, relative to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics are less likely to seek healthcare and have worse physical and mental health status following the activation of Secure Communities. It appears that the negative spillover effects are mostly driven by psychological rather than income effects.
Chapter 3, joint with Leah Boustan and Tammy Tseng, explores how Asian immigration has affected cities, neighborhoods and schools. We study white flight from Asian arrivals in high-socioeconomic-status Californian school districts from 2000-2016 using initial settlement patterns and national immigrant flows to instrument for entry. We find that, as Asian students arrive, white student enrollment declines in higher-income suburbs. These patterns cannot be fully explained by racial animus, housing prices, or correlations with Black/Hispanic arrivals. Parental fears of academic competition may play a role.},

	abstract = {Most papers that employ Differences-in-Differences estimation (DD) use many years of data and focus on serially correlated outcomes but ignore that the resulting standard errors are inconsistent. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its “effect” as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an “effect” significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a “pre”- and “post”-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

	abstract = {Approximately a quarter of the 43 million immigrants living in the United States are thought to be undocumented. Yet, the lack of accurate population-level information about undocumented immigrants provides fertile ground for public misconceptions, political and media hype, and false claims. The goal is to determine how well descriptions of the undocumented population are likely to mirror the reality of undocumented immigrants’ lives in the US. We compare (1) the distribution of the population by documentation status and (2) distributions of the characteristics of undocumented and documented immigrants produced by two methods. The first method (the “decomposition method”) is a commonly used strategy used in previous work and the second method is an alternative, independent method developed in this article. We used the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LAFANS). The existing decomposition method works reasonably well if the data contains information on whether respondents are naturalized citizens or and lawful permanent residents. However, when these variables are missing or problematic, the decomposition method produces biased results. The actual undocumented population in the US may be even more socioeconomically disadvantaged than studies based on existing decomposition methods indicate. This article evaluates methods to conduct reasonably accurate nationally representative, policy relevant research on the lives of undocumented immigrants without potentially jeopardizing members of this vulnerable population.},

In this article, we show that the ACA has deepened the ‘brightness’ of unauthorised immigrants’ symbolic and social exclusion within the US health care system via a significant boundary expansion for US citizens and long-term legal immigrants that has no parallel for unauthorised immigrants. As an alternative model, we highlight two subnational jurisdictions—one city/county (San Francisco) and one state (Massachusetts)—to show how they have played more promising roles to reframe and unfreeze this ‘frozen-out’ population. While we demonstrate commonalities in how San Francisco and Massachusetts have successfully ‘blurred’ unauthorised immigrants’ symbolic exclusion and reduced their barriers to health care at the subnational level, we also highlight their mutual limitations, which signal an ongoing need for federal inclusion currently out of sight. Our findings speak to contemporary debates about whether immigrant incorporation is best achieved at the supranational, national or subnational levels.},

	abstract = {Over 11 million undocumented persons reside in the United States, and there has been a heated debate over the impact of legislative or executive efforts to regularize the status of this population. This paper examines the determinants of earnings for undocumented workers. Using newly developed methods that impute undocumented status for foreign-born persons sampled in microdata surveys, the study documents a number of findings. First, the age-earnings profile of undocumented workers lies far below that of legal immigrants and of native workers, and is almost perfectly flat during the prime working years. Second, the unadjusted gap in the log hourly wage between undocumented workers and natives is very large (around 40 percent), but half of this gap disappears once the calculation adjusts for differences in observable socioeconomic characteristics, particularly educational attainment. Finally, the adjusted wage of undocumented workers rose rapidly in the past decade. As a result, there was a large decline in the wage penalty associated with undocumented status. The relatively small magnitude of the current wage penalty suggests that a regularization program may only have a modest impact on the wage of undocumented workers.},

We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference.

	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay documents an empirical study of how the growth of imports from China changes post-secondary education decisions in Korea. As China has become “the world’s factory”, the availability of low-skilled jobs has become worse in countries that import products from China. I exploited cross-industry and cross-local labor market variations in import growth from China to investigate how Korean students’ post-secondary education decisions were influenced by more intensive import competition from China. Using administrative statistics from high schools between 2000 and 2015, I found that in regions more affected by Chinese imports, more students pursued a college degree after finishing high school. Consistent with the enrollment pattern, I found that in Korea, a surge in Chinese imports caused huge job losses, especially for low-educated workers, which decreased the opportunity cost and increased the marginal benefit of a college education. However, there is heterogeneity in the enrollments based on gender and type of educational institution. In the more affected regions, male students tended to enroll in 4-year universities rather than 2-year colleges, while female students were more likely to choose 2-year colleges. The findings of this study suggest that negative social norms and smaller employment losses for working women led to a more limited increase in educational investment among women.
The second essay recounts an investigation into how parents change child-related investments in rural China after introducing a pension program that provides them with an alternative to adult children as a source of support. Exploiting regional variation in the timing of the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) in China, I found that parents who enrolled in the NRPS spent more on their children’s education. Specifically, the increase in educational spending is observed for the parents of sons. In terms of the number of children, although the effect on the probability of giving birth to a baby is not statistically significant, I found that parents enrolled in NRPS were more likely to give birth to a boy. Considering the introduction of a pension scheme as lowering the price for future incomes, this implies that the income effect is more significant than the intertemporal substitution effect leading to higher investments in their children. Moreover, these results suggest that NRPS does not weaken son preference in China, although this program can provide old-age support for parents instead of sons who traditionally did this.
The third essay revisits literature estimating the effect of unilateral divorce law on the divorce rate with US panel data. This literature could not have a consensus on the impact of this law on the divorce rate because two-way fixed effects and event study regressions are not robust to heterogeneous treatment effects. In this case, estimates cannot be interpreted as a causal effect. By using alternative estimators to address this issue (e.g., de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfuille 2020), I found that the divorce rate rose after the adoption of this law, and this rise reversed afterward. The average of the dynamic effects is smaller than previous papers found.},

Methods Using data from the American Community Survey years 2011-2015, we conducted a difference-in-differences regression analysis to test for changes in the probability of low-income childless adults having insurance in states that expanded Medicaid versus states that did not expand, in rural versus urban areas. Analyses employed survey weights, adjusted for covariates, and included a set of falsification tests as well as sensitivity analyses. Findings Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act increased the probability of Medicaid coverage for targeted populations in rural and urban areas, with a significantly greater increase in rural areas (P {\textless} .05), but some of these gains were offset by reductions in individual purchased insurance among rural populations (P {\textless} .01). Falsification tests showed that the insurance increases were specific to low-income childless adults, as expected, and were largely insignificant for other populations. Conclusions The Medicaid expansion increased the probability of having “any insurance” for the pooled urban and rural low-income populations, and it specifically increased Medicaid coverage more in rural versus urban populations. There was some evidence that the expansion was accompanied by some shifting from individual purchased insurance to Medicaid in rural areas, and there is a need for future work to understand the implications of this shift on expenditures, access to care and utilization.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pooled, cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for 19 states and New York City including low-income adults with a live birth between 2012 and 2019. EXPOSURE Giving birth in a state that offered public insurance coverage for postpartum care to recently documented or undocumented immigrants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported receipt of postpartum care by the category of coverage offered (full coverage: states that offered publicly funded postpartum care regardless of immigration status; moderate coverage: states that offered publicly funded postpartum care to lawfully residing immigrants without a 5-year waiting period, but did not offer postpartum care to undocumented immigrants; no coverage: states that did not offer publicly funded postpartum care to lawfully present immigrants before 5 years of legal residence or to undocumented immigrants).
RESULTS The study included 72 981 low-income adults (20 971 immigrants [29\%] and 52 010 nonimmigrants [71\%]). Of the 19 included states and New York City, 6 offered full coverage, 9 offered moderate coverage, and 4 offered no coverage; 1 state (Oregon) switched from offering moderate coverage to offering full coverage. Compared with the states that offered full coverage, receipt of postpartum care among immigrants was 7.0–percentage-points lower (95\% CI, −10.6 to −3.4 percentage points) in the states that offered moderate coverage and 11.3–percentage-points lower (95\% CI, −13.9 to −8.8 percentage points) in the states that offered no coverage. The differences in the receipt of postpartum care among immigrants relative to nonimmigrants were also associated with the coverage categories. Compared with the states that offered full coverage, there was a 3.3–percentage-point larger difference (95\% CI, −5.3 to −1.4 percentage points) in the states that offered moderate coverage and a 7.7–percentage-point larger difference (95\% CI, −10.3 to −5.0 percentage points) in the states that offered no coverage.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with states without insurance restrictions, immigrants living in states with public insurance restrictions were less likely to receive postpartum care. Restricting public insurance coverage may be an important policy-driven barrier to receipt of recommended pregnancy care and improved maternal health among immigrants.},

	abstract = {This research note examines response and allocation rates for legal status questions asked in publicly available U.S. surveys to address worries that the legal status of immigrants cannot be reliably measured. Contrary to such notions, we find that immigrants’ non-response rates to questions about legal status are typically not higher than non-response rates to other immigration-related questions, such as country of birth and year of immigration. Further exploration of two particular surveys – the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LAFANS) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) – reveals that these data sources produce profiles of the unauthorized immigrant population that compare favorably to independently estimated profiles. We also find in the case of the SIPP that the introduction of legal status questions does not appear to have an appreciable “chilling effect” on the subsequent survey participation of unauthorized immigrant respondents. Based on the results, we conclude that future data collection efforts should include questions about legal status to (1) improve models of immigrant incorporation; and (2) better position assimilation research to inform policy discussions.},

	abstract = {Purpose
This population-representative study examined the association of Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) with postpartum depressive symptoms among low-income women.
Methods
We used data from the 2009 – 2018 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys for 13 Medicaid expansion and 7 non-expansion states. We used a generalized difference-in-differences approach and log-binomial regression models to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the likelihood of postpartum depressive symptoms among low-income women (≤138\% of the federal poverty level) who delivered in expansion and non-expansion states.
Results
Adjusting for state and year fixed-effects and individual- and state-level confounders, low-income women who delivered in Medicaid expansion states had a decreased likelihood of postpartum depressive symptoms compared to low-income women who delivered in non-expansion states (PR = 0.93, 95\% CI 0.80, 1.07). Results were largely consistent across multiple sensitivity analysis specifications. Results were robust to falsification tests among women with incomes {\textgreater}138\% of the federal poverty level.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that Medicaid expansion may be associated with a small reduction in the likelihood of postpartum depressive symptoms. Future research should examine the potential for implementation of multiple supportive policies to achieve larger gains in treatment and prevention.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The U.S. Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion, which allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income adults beginning in 2014, has reduced the risk factors for child neglect and physical abuse, including parental financial insecurity, substance use, and untreated mental illness. This study examines the associations between Medicaid expansion and the rates of overall, first-time, and repeat reports of child neglect and physical abuse incidents per 100,000 children aged 0–5, 6–12, and 13–17 years.
Methods
The 2008–2018 National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System was analyzed using an extension of the difference-in-differences approach that accounts for staggered policy implementation across time. Owing to evidence of nonparallel preperiod trends in the 6 states that expanded Medicaid from 2015 to 2017, the main analyses included 20 states that newly expanded Medicaid in 2014 and 18 states that did not expand Medicaid from 2008 to 2018. Analyses were conducted in 2020–2021.
Results
Medicaid expansion states were associated with reductions of 13.4\% (95\% CI= −24.2, −9.6), 14.8\% (95\% CI= −26.4, −1.4), and 16.0\% (−27.6, −2.6) in the average rate of child neglect reports per 100,000 children aged 0–5, 6–12, and 13–17 years, per state-year, relative to control states. Expansion was associated with a 17.3\% (95\% CI= −28.9, −3.8) reduction in the rate of first-time neglect reports among children aged 0–5 years and with 16.6\% (95\% CI= −29.3, −1.6) and 18.7\% (95\% CI= −32.5, −2.1) reductions in the rates of repeat neglect reports among children aged 6–12 and 13–17 years, respectively. There were no statistically significant associations between Medicaid expansion and the rates of physical abuse among children in any age group.
Conclusions
Insurance expansions for low-income adults may reduce child neglect.},

	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays:
“The Effect of Women's Access to Free Health Care on Breastfeeding Practices: Evidence from Armenia” examines how women's decisions regarding breastfeeding respond to increased maternal access to medical care. Specifically, I examine the effects of the Armenian “For You, Women" program which grants women access to free health care services for a period of one month each year. Employing a differences-in-differences specification, I explore how the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding are affected by the program. I find that access to free women's health care leads to a decline in the likelihood of breastfeeding.
In “Impacts of the Relocation Program on Native American Migration and Fertility," I estimate the historical migratory and fertility effects of the US Relocation Program. Between 1952 and 1973, the US federal government attempted to move Native Americans off reservations and to urban areas under the promises of financial assistance and job training. Using the variation in which cities were targeted by the program, I employ a difference-in-differences strategy and estimate that the Relocation Program significantly increased the Native American population in target cities. I also find evidence that second-generation Native American women living in cities have a substantially lower fertility rate than Native American women living on tribal land. Jointly, these findings indicate that this federal program substantially shifted the spatial distribution of the Native American population in the US throughout the 20th century.
Finally, “Right to Carry Laws and Intimate Partner Homicide," examines to what extend right to carry laws impact intimate partner homicide rates. I employ generalized difference-in-differences, event study, and synthetic control methods specifications to examine the impact of right to carry laws on annual, state-level intimate partner homicide rates. I find no evidence of an impact of right to carry laws on female victim intimate partner homicide rates. While there are some specifications that suggest a decrease in male victim firearm intimate partner homicide rates, these results are limited and fluctuating across model specifications. Overall, the estimates are noisy but suggest little evidence of an impact, highlighting the importance of more formalized sensitivity analysis for testing the robustness of results.},

	abstract = {The legalization of marijuana has emerged as a critical public policy issue, with far-reaching implications for health, education, and government programs at both the state and federal levels. The three essays of this dissertation show that medical marijuana legalization (MML) has a negative effect in each of these areas. The first essay shows that the enactment of MMLs can exacerbate the crisis of overdose deaths in the United States. The study analyzes three key areas: the rate of overdose deaths caused by both legal and illegal drugs, the impact of MML on social norms regarding the perceived harm of frequent use marijuana, and an investigation into the gateway theory by examining the use of other addictive drugs. I find that MMLs increase deaths attributed to overdose by 21.5\%. MMLs also increase the number of deaths due to prescribed opioids by 44.6\%, and deaths from all opioids (heroin and cocaine in addition to prescribed opioids) by 37.2 \%. Results suggest an overall increase in the use of marijuana, primarily due to lower perceived risk among adolescents. Additionally, results show an increase in hospital admissions due to substance abuse. The analysis suggests that legalizing medical marijuana may exaggerate the current problem of drug overdose in the United States.
The second essay examines the impact of improved access to medical marijuana, measured by the proximity of schools to the nearest dispensary, on the academic performance of high school students in California. Students in schools farther from a marijuana dispensary have higher academic performance as measured through AP, ACT, SAT scores, and average GPA, and lower number of suspensions due to violence and illicit drug use. To show this, I construct the first geocoded dataset on marijuana dispensary and high school locations, use newly developed difference-in-differences estimators that rule out any bias due to heterogeneous treatment effects and explore dynamic responses. This essay emphasizes the importance of balancing the need for patients to access medical marijuana with the potential risks posed to students, especially adolescents.
Finally, the third essay shows that in the long term, MMLs increase the number of disabled workers who receive Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) because of mental health issues. SSDI is a major social insurance program that provides benefits to workers who become disabled, and understanding how policy changes in other areas may impact this program is important. In this study, there were important differences between the results of a two-way fixed effects model and a new model by Callaway and Santa’Anna. MMLs, in theory, could either increase or decrease the number of SSDI recipients, and traditional fixed effects models suggest both could be at play; however, only the negative effect is robust to correction for heterogeneous effects. This highlights the need for future research to understand the true impact of medical marijuana legalization on SSDI.},

	abstract = {(1) Chapter 1 - this paper demonstrates that expanding access to Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) to lower-income women leads to positive selection in the health of the cohorts of children being born. I exploit the staggered timing of three privately funded programs which distributed LARCs at no cost to lower income-women in Colorado, Iowa and St. Louis. I implement an event-study design which compares trends in treated counties with other U.S. counties with similar family planning clinics, but which did not receive additional funding to distribute free LARCs. I find that expanded LARC access led to reductions of approximately 1.0 ‘extremely preterm’ births and 1.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. I find significant reductions in deaths due to birth defects, maternal pregnancy complications, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and homicide. My estimates imply a reduction of approximately 90 infant deaths and 85 extremely preterm births per year in Colorado. Using a back of the envelope calculation, I find that the Colorado program, which was funded by a \$27 million donation, led to reductions in ventilation costs for extremely preterm births of approximately \$5.6 million per year. These results suggest that giving lower-income women the means to control their fertility has the potential to reduce adverse infant health outcomes and could decrease the infant mortality gap which exists between the US and other leading economies.
(2) Chapter 2 - In late January, 1990, the salary of every National Hockey League (NHL) player was suddenly disclosed, ending a decades-long culture of pay secrecy. I find that underpaid players respond to this new information by reallocating effort from defense to offense, which is more highly compensated within the league. Underpaid players begin scoring more, but allow their teams to get scored on by even more than the additional goals they provide. Asymmetrically, overpaid players do not become more defensive-minded. Consistent with reference-dependent utility theory, I find suggestive evidence that this shift is more pronounced for underpaid players who play for teams with higher overall payrolls, as these players likely have a larger discrepancy between their actual salary and their reference point.
(3) Chapter 3 - Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes have become an increasingly popular policy to combat the worldwide obesity epidemic, but relatively little is known about their impact on health outcomes, particularly among high school aged students. In this paper, I use public-use data from the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System (YRBSS) to determine whether high school students living in three of the American cities which have implemented SSB taxes have experienced public health improvements. Using an event-study design that compares outcomes in treated districts to a group of similar control districts, I find significant reductions in both SSB consumption and average BMI, with suggestive evidence that the improvements are concentrated among female and non-white respondents.},

Therefore, subsidies have poor “target efficiency”: hospitals that provide large amounts of uncompensated care may not receive subsidies (exclusion error), while hospitals that provide little uncompensated care may receive subsidies (inclusion error). Medicaid expansions may exacerbate poor targeting by increasing Medicaid patient volume while reducing uncompensated care. Using hospital administrative data from 2003 to 2019, I quantify the target efficiency of Medicare and Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments and the 340B drug discount program and quantify how changes in Medicaid eligibility affect safety-net subsidy receipt and target efficiency. I find that the ACA Medicaid expansion increased participation in Medicare DSH and 340B, especially among non-safety-net hospitals (inclusion errors) resulting in a shift of approximately \$5B from safety-net to non-safety-net hospitals. I find the opposite for a Medicaid contraction in Tennessee in 2005. My results demonstrate an unintended consequence of Medicaid-based eligibility criteria: changes in Medicaid coverage affect the allocation of public subsidies for safety-net patients.},

The first chapter examines how government investment in technology creates spillover effects in the production of knowledge, using the 1960s Space Race as an empirical setting. Combining the known universe of patent records with information on their federal reliance, along with a difference in differences design, I estimate that NASA-exposed fields increased their patenting relative to non-exposed fields, and that these patents were more impactful by citation metrics. To study the degree to which these results are driven by the reallocation of scientists and engineers, I use the inventor information in the patent documents to show that NASA-affiliated inventors obtained their first ever patents after joining NASA or obtaining a NASA contract, and not before.
The second chapter contributes to data methods in the economics of innovation by comparing traditional rules-based data linkage to machine learning methods. I apply a supervised learning strategy to link patents issued between 1840 and 1900 to individual establishment microdata in the 1870 Census of Manufactures, and conclude that a simple rules-based approach combined with manual verification plausibly yields higher confidence links. I contribute a novel dataset for future researchers by performing this higher confidence linkage.
The final chapter provides an overview of the historical patent datasets used throughout the dissertation, with a focus on their accuracy, coverage, and overlap.},

	abstract = {Because no large-scale survey records individuals’ legal status, previous literature often use Hispanic or Mexican non-citizen as a proxy to identify undocumented immigrants in survey data. This paper compares the ethnicity proxy with the recently developed residual method in identifying undocumented immigrants in two aspects: how closely they can match official statistics and how they differ when evaluating the schooling and labor market effects of the DREAM Act and DACA. The study finds that the residual method outperforms the ethnicity proxy in matching the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services statistics on undocumented immigrants. Consistent with previous literature, results from both methods also suggest that the DREAM Act increases college enrollment, while DACA decreases college enrollment and increases the probability of working. The residual method produces policy effect estimates in the same direction as does the Hispanic non-citizen proxy approach, but larger in magnitude, suggesting that the ethnicity proxy could underestimate policy effects.},

	abstract = {We apply standard demographic principles of inflows and outflows to estimate the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States, using the best available data, including some that have only recently become available. Our analysis covers the years 1990 to 2016. We develop an estimate of the number of undocumented immigrants based on parameter values that tend to underestimate undocumented immigrant inflows and overstate outflows; we also show the probability distribution for the number of undocumented immigrants based on simulating our model over parameter value ranges. Our conservative estimate is 16.7 million for 2016, nearly fifty percent higher than the most prominent current estimate of 11.3 million, which is based on survey data and thus different sources and methods. The mean estimate based on our simulation analysis is 22.1 million, essentially double the current widely accepted estimate. Our model predicts a similar trajectory of growth in the number of undocumented immigrants over the years of our analysis, but at a higher level. While our analysis delivers different results, we note that it is based on many assumptions. The most critical of these concern border apprehension rates and voluntary emigration rates of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. These rates are uncertain, especially in the 1990’s and early 2000’s, which is when—both based on our modeling and the very different survey data approach—the number of undocumented immigrants increases most significantly. Our results, while based on a number of assumptions and uncertainties, could help frame debates about policies whose consequences depend on the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes and provides estimates of the undercount of the foreign-born in the US Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey (ACS). It confirms that a differential undercount occurred in the 2020 ACS. In particular, noncitizens that arrived from Central American countries after 1981 had undercount rates of 15–25 percent, but undercount of noncitizens that arrived from European countries in the same period was not detectable by the methods described in this paper. The Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) and others use ACS data to derive annual estimates of the US undocumented population. The Census Bureau recently reported that the total population count for the 2020 Census was consistent with the count for recent censuses, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and the Trump administration’s interference in the 2020 Census. Nonetheless, the accuracy of 2020 ACS data for the noncitizen population that arrived after 1981 remains a major concern given the fear generated by the Trump administration’s abusive rhetoric and anti-immigrant policies. The estimates set forth in this paper were derived by analyzing trends in annual ACS data for 2016–2020 compiled from the IPUMS website (Ruggles et al. 2021). Decennial census data cannot be used for this purpose because data on country of birth, citizenship, and year of immigration are not collected in the census. However, it is reasonable to believe that the 2020 census and the 2020 ACS experienced similar challenges because they were conducted under comparable conditions. The patterns of undercount of noncitizens described here for the 2020 ACS are likely mirrored in the 2020 census and will reduce federal funding and representation to affected cities and states for the next decade.},

	abstract = {Background
Citizenship status among the foreign born is a crucial indicator of social and political incorporation, yet there are good reasons to suspect that citizenship status is inaccurately reported on U.S. surveys.

Objective
This paper updates research carried out in the mid-1990s by  on the extent to which foreign-born non-citizen respondents in U.S. government-sponsored surveys misreport as naturalized citizens.

Methods
We compare demographic estimates of the resident naturalized foreign-born population in 2010, based on administrative data, to estimates from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS).

Results
Similar to previous research, we find that misreporting in the ACS is especially high among immigrants from all countries/regions who report fewer than five years in the U.S. We also find that among longer-term foreign-born residents, misreporting is concentrated only among those originating in Mexico, especially men, a finding that diverges from Passel and Clark in that we find no evidence of over-reporting among immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean. Finally, the estimated magnitude of misreporting, especially among longer-term Mexican-born men, is sensitive to assumptions about the rate of emigration in our administrative-based demographic estimates, and assumptions about coverage error in the ACS, though altering these assumptions does not change the conclusions drawn from the general patterns of the results.

Conclusions
For applications that use citizenship as an indicator of legal status, we recommend that self-reported data on citizenship be accepted at face value for all groups except those with less than five years of U.S. residence and Mexican men.},

	abstract = {In 2010, the long form Decennial Census was not used for the first time in several decades, replaced instead by the American Community Survey (ACS). While the ACS has been collecting data for more than a decade, the first census tract results were released in 2010. The ACS collects its data based on a rolling sample. It is purported to have many advantages over the Decennial Census, including frequently updated data, less overall cost, and better coverage. We have found, however, that the ACS can produce highly inaccurate data, in part because of reliance on extremely small samples in sparsely populated neighborhoods. We explore these dynamics through a community survey which replicates ACS questions while employing the old Decennial Census long form sampling strategy of requesting information from one in six households in a single inner city census tract in Nashville, Tennessee. Our results show that the ACS has grossly underestimated the total population and the number of people living in poverty in the neighborhood, among other variables of interest. Through an examination of the number of census tracts with very small sample sizes and a comparison of recent ACS results with the 2010 Decennial Census, we show that the problems identified in this single tract occur throughout the country. In addition, we consider how statistical profiles of neighborhoods derived from the ACS and other data sources enable wide ranges of action in those neighborhoods, action which can be harmful given inaccurate and/or decontextualized data.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing need to understand the structural drivers of immigrant health inequities, including xenophobic and racist policies at the state level in the United States. Databases aggregate state policies related to immigration and research using single year indices examines state policy and immigrant health. Yet none of these sources use a theoretically informed social determinants of immigrant health approach to consider state environments longitudinally, include both exclusionary and inclusionary policies, and are relevant to immigrants from any region of the world or ethnic group. Using an established social determinants of immigrant health framework, a measure of structural xenophobia was created using fourteen policies across five domains: access to public health benefits, higher education, labor and employment, driver's licenses and identification, and immigration enforcement over a ten-year period (2009–2019). To create the Immigration Policy Climate (IPC) index, we used data from state legislatures as well as policy databases from foundations, advocacy organizations, and scholarly articles. We identified and coded 714 US state policies across the 50 US States and the District of Columbia from 2009 to 2019. We calculated annual IPC index scores (range: 12 – 12) as a continuous measure (negative scores: exclusionary; positive scores: inclusionary). Results show that the US has an exclusionary immigration policy climate at the state-level (mean IPC score of −2.5). From 2009 to 2019, two-thirds of state-level immigration policies are exclusionary towards immigrants. About 75\% of states experienced a 4-point change or less on the IPC index, and no state changed from largely exclusive to largely inclusive. By aggregating comprehensive, detailed data and a measure of state-level immigration policies over time, the IPC index provides population health researchers with rigorous evidence with which to assess structural xenophobia and an opportunity for longitudinal research on health inequities and immigrant health.},

A particular focus is given to non-developed countries, which tend to face tighter restrictions than rich countries in many aspects. Consequently, important policies can have adverse effects due to poor implementation that might not be evident at first glance.
The first chapter studies the Chilean health insurance market to understand how the rules that link premiums to income distort incentives and their consequences for the public option. I also assess how the rules may interact with the rapid income growth that Chile has been experiencing. I find that the institutional setting in Chile allows private insurers to effectively screen out poor agents who do not generate profits. I also simulate how demand for plans and medical spending would change when incomes grow, showing that agents more likely to switch to private plans are inexpensive to cover but generate low revenues and reduce private profit margins. The public option benefits substantially from income growth, reducing its deficit.
The second chapter, joint with Luiz Fontes, studies the Brazilian Psychiatric Reform, which introduced mental health centers (CAPS) as community-based substitutes for inpatient care. CAPS reduced psychiatric hospitalizations, but the effects were concentrated on patients with schizophrenia, a condition CAPS cannot adequately treat. Introducing centers also increased the rate of violent crimes, which is consistent with the hypothesis from the criminology literature that inpatient care reduces violent crime via an incapacitation effect on individuals with schizophrenia.
The last chapter, joint with Rudi Rocha and Rodrigo Soares, studies the adoption of genetically modified soybean in Brazil and the consequent increase in the use of glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in the world. Decades-old laboratory studies suggest that glyphosate has very low toxicity, a claim that has been recently disputed by the scientific literature. We find that the average increase in glyphosate use in the sample led to an increase in the infant mortality rate of 5\% of the average through externality effects in a real-world agricultural setting.},

The legal status of foreign-born NHIS respondents is imputed using a non-parametric machine learning model built based on information from the 2004, 2008 and 2014 cohorts of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that, despite exposure to numerous additional risk factors, the undocumented population experienced a more pronounced Healthy Migrant Effect, with lower odds of reporting fair or poor self-rated health, any physician-diagnosed chronic conditions or being obese. The observed patterns in undocumented health outcomes may be related to the additional challenges and exclusionary policies associated with undocumented migration that could in turn lead to a more pronounced selection of healthy and resilient individuals.},

K-fold cross-validation was used to test model performance. The LAFANS is a randomized, multilevel, in-person survey of households residing in Los Angeles County, California, consisting of 2 waves. Wave 1 began in April 2000 and ended in January 2002, and wave 2 began in August 2006 and ended in December 2008. The machine learning model was then applied to a nationally representative database, the 2016-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), to predict health care expenditures and utilization among unauthorized and authorized immigrants and US-born individuals. A generalized linear model analyzed health care expenditures. Logistic regression modeling estimated dichotomous use of emergency department (ED), inpatient, outpatient, and office-based physician visits by immigrant groups with adjusting for confounding factors. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2019, to October 14, 2020.Self-reported immigration status (US-born, authorized, and unauthorized status).Annual health care expenditures per capita and use of ED, outpatient, inpatient, and office-based physician care.Of 47 199 MEPS respondents with nonmissing data, 35 079 (74.3\%) were US born, 10 816 (22.9\%) were authorized immigrants, and 1304 (2.8\%) were unauthorized immigrants (51.7\% female; mean age, 47.6 [95\% CI, 47.4-47.8] years). Compared with authorized immigrants and US-born individuals, unauthorized immigrants were more likely to be aged 18 to 44 years (80.8\%), Latino (96.3\%), and Spanish speaking (95.2\%) and to have less than 12 years of education (53.7\%). Half of unauthorized immigrants (47.1\%) were uninsured compared with 15.9\% of authorized immigrants and 6.0\% of US-born individuals. Mean annual health care expenditures per person were \$1629 (95\% CI, \$1330-\$1928) for unauthorized immigrants, \$3795 (95\% CI, \$3555-\$4035) for authorized immigrants, and \$6088 (95\% CI, \$5935-\$6242) for US-born individuals.Contrary to much political discourse in the US, this cross-sectional study found no evidence that unauthorized immigrants are a substantial economic burden on safety net facilities such as EDs.

	abstract = {Environmental and epidemiological research has linked exposure to air pollution and extreme temperatures during the prenatal period to the incidence of fetal and infant death, adverse birth outcomes, and worse outcomes in adulthood and across generations. To minimize these adverse effects, policymakers can reduce ambient exposures (i.e., mitigation) or intervene with some program that lessens the impacts (i.e., adaptation). The first two chapters focus on the effects of air pollution shocks and the efficacy of free prenatal care to lessen its adverse effects on health at birth. The last chapter focuses on the effects of extreme temperatures and the efficacy of free prenatal care and air conditioning to lessen its adverse effects on birth outcomes (e.g., birthweight, weeks of gestation, low birthweight rate).
The first chapter shows that the estimates of sulfur dioxide (SO2) effects on birth outcomes are susceptible to the window used to measure exposure during the prenatal period. Measuring exposure from conception to birth, I find a negative impact of SO2 on birthweight. In contrast, the estimate is positive when exposure is measured from conception to 39 weeks. Using each county’s 52-week lagged SO2 concentrations as a placebo, I find that using a fixed 39-week window from the date of conception is the most reliable methodology. However, this methodology's estimates indicate that higher SO2 concentrations increase birth weight. I present evidence suggesting that this counterintuitive result is caused by livebirth bias (i.e., the infants that survive pollution shocks are positively selected). I overcome this problem by using the number of infants born with non-adverse outcomes per woman of reproductive age as the dependent variable instead of traditional outcomes (e.g., birthweight, low birthweight, or preterm birth rate). Applying this transformation, I find that SO2 worsens health at birth, and its effects increase with the pollutant’s concentration (i.e., the SO2-birth outcome damage function is convex). Furthermore, the effects are more prominent for blacks than whites.
The second chapter tests whether access to free prenatal care lessens the adverse health effects of exposure to air pollution in utero. I study how the expansion of Medicaid (publicly-provided health insurance for low-income households) changed the effect of prenatal exposure to SO2 on fetal death and birth outcomes. Theoretically, the effect is ambiguous: Even if free prenatal supplementation (i.e., vitamins, iron, calcium) lessens the biological impact of air pollution, there could be a substitution between access to prenatal care and pollution avoidance. High SO2 concentrations increased fetal deaths, and Medicaid’s expansion attenuated this effect. Estimating the impact of Medicaid on the SO2-birth outcome relationship is empirically challenging because the infants marginally saved by Medicaid could be positively or negatively selected. The analysis of traditional outcome variables (e.g., birthweight, low birthweight rate) suggests that Medicaid had no impact or even intensified the damage of SO2 on health at birth. To account for the possibility of livebirth (i.e, sample selection) bias, I instead analyzed the number of non-low birth weight (i.e., healthy) infants per woman of reproductive age (nlbw/w). Using this dependent variable, I find that Medicaid mitigated the effect of SO2 on nlbw/w in low-pollution areas and at the national level. Furthermore, the reduction was larger for blacks than whites; thus, Medicaid improved environmental justice in the US by shrinking the gap in the health effects of in-utero air pollution between races.
The third chapter tests whether access to free prenatal care and air conditioning lessens the adverse health effects of extreme temperatures in a non-rural setting. I study how the expansion of Medicaid changed the effect of extreme in-utero temperatures on birth outcomes in the US. In developed countries, physiological stress is the primary mechanism through which temperature affects pregnancy outcomes. In rural areas of the developing world, it can also do so indirectly through changes in real income, increased incidence of maternal disease, or increased conflicts. The results suggest that access to prenatal care did not lessen the impacts of extreme temperatures on birth outcomes. However, the diffusion of air conditioning reduced the effects of extremely hot days.
Overall, the results of these chapters suggest that providing low-income women with free prenatal care is a promising intervention to lessen the health impacts of in-utero air pollution but not those of extreme temperatures. On the other hand, air conditioning is a promising intervention to lessen the health effects of extreme heat on birth outcomes.},

	abstract = {Meaningful use of electronic health records (EHR), characterized by the use of certified EHR technology to enhance the safety, quality, and efficiency of care, plays a crucial role in optimizing EHR functionalities for facilitating care coordination and health information exchange. Despite the widespread adoption of EHR as a result of the EHR incentive program, a large proportion of physicians continue to struggle with meeting meaningful use criteria. While literature has extensively examined the facilitating conditions and barriers to EHR use, limited research has focused on social influence, a key construct in the technology acceptance model that determines physicians’ intention to use and behavior in utilizing technologies. Given significant fragmentation of the healthcare system, it is important to understand the role of meaningful use in the context of coordination and transitions of care. The lack of empirical evidence in this domain creates a knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of the EHR incentive program and the meaningful use standards it established.
This dissertation comprises three empirical studies that collectively contribute to the understanding of meaningful use of EHR in office-based physicians, providing insights into the challenges and benefits associated with meaningful use and its implementation. The first two chapters delve into the factors that influence physicians’ meaningful use practices. Specifically, the first chapter studies the association between physician relationships and meaningful use performance, and the second chapter seeks to understand whether switching to different EHR vendors hinders physicians’ achievement of meaningful use requirements. The third chapter shifts the focus towards the downstream impact of meaningful use, assessing its association with patient sharing between physicians. Chapter 1 estimates the association of physician network structure with physicians’ performance on meaningful use criteria in 2016. The analysis employs social network analysis techniques and data from the DocGraph HOP Teaming file to construct physician patient-sharing networks at the hospital referral regions level. We calculate a set of measures that characterize the centrality and density of physician networks. We focus on meaningful use criteria that were designed to enhance care efficiency and coordination between physicians. The findings indicate that physicians who were more connected with other physicians or occupied a central position within their networks tended to demonstrate better performance on electronic prescribing and patient electronic access criteria. In contrast, physicians situated within densely interconnected networks were more likely to exhibit poorer performance on these two criteria, suggesting that the isolated local networks may diminish physicians’ perceived usefulness of EHR. These findings contribute to the understanding of the variation in meaningful use across physicians and suggest that future interventions may leverage physician interaction relationships to promote the utilization of EHR functionalities for effective care coordination.
Chapter 2 assesses the association of switching EHR vendors with physicians’ meaningful use between 2011 and 2016. We use a difference-in-differences study design to disentangle the heterogeneous effect of vendor switching over time and across physicians who switched vendors at different time points. The findings demonstrate a persistent negative impact of vendors switching on physicians’ meaningful use achievement. Notably, physicians in small practices were particularly vulnerable to the negative effect of vendor switching. These findings speak to the need for ongoing support during vendor switching period and the importance of interoperability across vendors to attain sustained, advanced use of EHR.
Chapter 3 investigates the relationship between meaningful use and patient sharing between physicians in stage 2 of the incentive program that aimed to improve care coordination through enhanced exchange and reconciliation of health information. The requirements for health information exchange and patient electronic access may reduce the time and financial costs associated with seeking care from differential physicians, thereby diminishing physicians’ monopoly power and patient sharing with others. We construct a panel of physician pairs who shared patients between 2014 and 2016 and compare the change in the number of patients shared between physician pairs across three groups: neither physician, only one physician, and both physicians achieving meaningful use. We also analyze the moderating effects of physician type and market conditions. The findings indicate a positive association between joint meaningful use achievement and patient sharing, particularly in unaffiliated physicians. The moderating effect of market concentration level highlights the deterrent effect of competitive pressures on patient and information sharing between physicians. These findings supplement existing research on the realized benefits of meaningful use of EHR and highlight the necessity for customized incentives that address competition concerns to encourage patient and information sharing in competitive market environments.},

Somewhat surprisingly, the estimation period has attracted less interest. It is usually routinely determined as a fixed window prior to the event announcement day. In this study, we propose a test that reduces the impact of potentially unrelated events during the estimation period. Our proposition is based on a two-state version of the classical market model as a return-generating process. We present standard specification and power analyses. The results highlight the importance of explicitly controlling for unrelated events occurring during the estimation window, especially in the presence of event-induced increase in return volatility.},

	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays in the area of Economics of Education. In Chapter 2, I examine the effects of for-profit institution closures following the 2014 gainful employment policy to understand how for-profit institutions impact outcomes for potential students. I use data on degree granting Title IV postsecondary education institutions from 2010 to 2019. I combine this institution information with data on student enrollment and debt at the county level as well as educational attainment at the Public Use Microdata Area level. The closing of for-profit institutions leads to a 4.5 percent decline in the number of enrolled students in counties that experienced closings, with the largest impacts on African-American and Hispanic students. However, for-profit institutions closures have a relatively small effect on educational attainment. Furthermore, the amount of student debt declines substantially, indicating for-profit institution closures produce sustained improvements in student debts.
In Chapter 3, I estimate the intergenerational effect of parents education on children’s criminal behavior using data from PSID. With the historical changes of compulsory schooling laws applied to the parent’s generation, which affects children’s crime only through parental education, I examine whether education has a causal intergenerational effect in crime reduction. From my empirical analysis, I find that an additional year of mother’s education decreases the probability of her child being arrested by 9.9 percentage points, and the probability of her child being on probation by 8.3 percentage points. This result suggests that the social return of education in terms of crime reduction is substantially underestimated without taking into account this long-term effect.
In Chapter 4, I study the effects of entry labor market conditions and break down the mechanism by using NLSY97. Using variation in the employment in the fields of study-cohort level, I find that cohorts experience a 5 percent increase in earnings on average during the first ten years in the labor market in response to a one-percentage-point growth in the employment level. I show that these earning gains due to the labor market condition in the year of entry can be explained by a decrease in the probability of working in an industry less matched to their skills and the switching behaviors.},

Yet, the profession remains vastly understudied. This three-paper dissertation aims to contribute to the existing literature on school counselors, particularly on the experiences of Black school counselors, by considering their work and policies that impact their work from a variety of perspectives. The first paper uses differences-in-differences to explore the effects of state-level school counselor mandates, finding that these mandates increase the number of school counselors, but no evidence that they affect student-to-counselor ratios. The second paper narrows the focus to master’s in school counseling programs and how faculty in those programs approach recruiting and retaining for diversity. I offer a typology of faculty, based on their perspectives on diversity and their level of engagement with diversity work. The third paper concentrates on the lived experiences of Black school counselors in Mississippi. Using a phenomenological approach, I find that Black school counselors bring an incredible wealth of knowledge to their roles, stemming from their background and complex social identities. However, they are often underutilized or exploited—many times due to their racial identity and the anti-Blackness that persists in our school systems. Taken together, these papers have implications for how policymakers craft legislation that affects school counselors, the efforts of graduate counseling programs to recruit and retain diverse classes of students, and our understanding of how Black school counselors experience their work.},

	abstract = {This thesis comprises three chapters of independent research on topics of labor economics. In Chapter 1, I show that empirical findings point to a robust negative relationship between local employment concentration and wages. Despite the scarcity of merger challenges on the grounds of decreased labor market competition, economic theory, case law, and amassed evidence justify the incorporation of labor markets in the scope of antitrust’s scrutiny. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature regarding the impact of mergers on employees and its relevance to antitrust policy. Additionally, it presents a summary of recommendations to antitrust agencies, drawing from the accumulated practice in the enforcement of product market competition.
In Chapter 2, I use matched employer-employee records merged with corporate tax information from 2003 to 2017 to estimate labor market-wide effects of mergers and acquisitions in Brazil. Pairs of commuting zone and industry sector define labor markets. In the following year of a merger, the market size falls by 10.8\%. The employment adjustment is concentrated in merging firms. For the firms not involved in M\&As, I estimate a 1.07\% decline in workers’ earnings and a positive, although not significant, increase in their size. Most mergers have a predicted impact of zero points in concentration, measured by the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI). In spillover firms, earnings decline similarly for mergers with high and low predicted changes in HHI. Contrary to the recent literature on market concentration in developed economies, I find no evidence of oligopsonistic behavior in Brazilian labor markets.
Lastly, Chapter 3 estimates the public wage premium relative to the private sector in the Brazilian economy. I use a rich linked employer-employee administrative dataset to compute the premium over average wages and along the earnings distribution. Exploratory analysis suggests that the average worker in the two sectors varies with respect to observable attributes. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition shows that, beyond differences in characteristics, public sector workers from most government branches and levels enjoy a positive earnings premium related to the government’s specific wage structure. Introducing worker fixed effects removes most of the premium variation along the earnings distribution; the total gap, as well as its characteristics and coefficients components, “flatten out” when endogenous selection is considered. For a policymaker to close the portion of the gap between public and private wages stemming from the public sector’s specific wage structure, a horizontal public wage freeze can be used.},

Chapter 1 studies the impact of immigration policy on firms' labor market strategies and the varying responses due to firms' financing constraints. By using the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) as an exogenous shock and analyzing over 200 million online job postings, the chapter reveals that jobs requiring lower complex problem-solving skills are more prevalent in regions with higher exposure to undocumented immigrants. This downgrading of skills is particularly notable among financially constrained firms.
Chapter 2 investigates the role of local agglomeration linkages in mitigating the negative effects of the Covid-19 shock on firm imports. Analyzing high-frequency data from over 7 million import transactions into the US, the chapter demonstrates that the disruptions to large firm imports and county-level employment were less severe in areas with greater Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan distribution. The effects are most significant in counties with numerous small suppliers, higher input-output industry linkages, and a larger share of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), emphasizing the importance of local resiliency in buffering trade supply shocks when SMEs are supported.
Chapter 3 utilizes microdata on the trading behavior of more than 13 million individuals to establish that the construction of new roads to previously unconnected areas enhances stock market participation. The chapter presents evidence supporting two channels: a financial inclusion channel, in which the establishment of new bank branches following road construction improves financial inclusion and subsequently stock market participation; and an information channel that captures enhanced information flow after road construction. This research suggests that improving physical infrastructure addresses the dual challenges of financial access and inadequate information, fostering a better integration of investors in remote and rural areas.},

	abstract = {From a farmer to a policymaker, there are various stakeholders that influence and are affected by the agricultural environment. This dissertation includes three essays that delve into the decision-making within the agricultural environment, exploring the incentives and outcomes for the stakeholders involved. With a focus on countries significant for global agriculture and food supply, these essays have important implications domestically and for the United States.
My first essay evaluates herding as a potential source of bias in the USDA’s international baseline projections. As USDA’s annual Agricultural Baseline Projections contribute significantly to agricultural policy in the United States, their accuracy is vital. Although the bias in the baselines has been documented in the literature, its sources have not been evaluated yet. I propose herding, a behavioral phenomenon, as a potential bias-inducing choice in the preparation of the projections. My results provide strong evidence for the herding of projection trends toward the United States and suggest that herding is rational and error-reducing only for corn yield and wheat import projections but not for other crops and variables, thereby impacting not only the agricultural policy in the US but also global agricultural markets.
The second essay evaluates the impact of an environmental policy that restricts land use for farmers in the context of the Brazilian Amazon, an area of crucial importance for global food supply. By analyzing the effects on both landowning farmers and landless peasants, this study examines the incentives generated and their subsequent influence on illegal occupations and land conflicts. The findings suggest that the policy leads to an increase in illegal occupations while decreasing land conflicts. Furthermore, by exploring heterogeneity in the impact relative to land values, I find that landowning farmers and squatters both make strategic choices about whether to engage in conflict depending on the value of the land being contested.
In the final essay, I focus on farmers’ profitability during the Indian green revolution, a transformative period in agricultural development. This study explores the evolution of the well-established inverse size-productivity relationship over the three decades spanning the green revolution and explores the contribution of new technologies to it. The implications extend beyond India, as agricultural productivity and economic outcomes in India have a direct impact on global food supply and trade, including potential consequences for other nations undergoing agricultural advancements.
Together, these three essays contribute to the field of agricultural economics by examining decision-making aspects and their ramifications in the agricultural environment of the United States and the countries that are major trade partners of the United States.},

The conflict unfolds across various aspects of business operations, banking policies, company management, organizational changes, and lawsuits related to antitrust violations. This dissertation includes two chapters on the industrial organization and economics of card payment systems, with a focus on the reorganization of the ownership structure of the two dominant card processing networks. In the first chapter, I explore the effects of Visa’s and MasterCard’s new ownership structure on bank card revenue. Employing two separate causal analyses, I compare revenue metrics of banks within the MasterCard (Visa) network to those in the Visa (MasterCard) network, as well as American Express and Discover, before and after Visa’s and MasterCard’s initial public offerings (IPOs). I find evidence that the new ownership structure increased interchange income for MasterCard issuing banks, while decreased income for Visa-only issuing banks. These results are robust. In the second chapter, I investigate how the exercise of market power affected interchange rates of generalpurpose cards. Using aggregate data on credit, signature-debit, and PIN-debit cards between 1996 and 2019, I find that following its IPO, MasterCard decreased credit card and signature-debit card rates by 6-21 basis points and increased its PIN-debit cards interchange rates by 13-24 basis points, on average. I addition, I implement a two-way fixed effects model with differential timing where I find that signature-debit rates decreased on average between 13 and 16 basis points, following the initial public offerings of the networks. Lastly, my investigation extends to examining the competitive effects of MasterCard’s response to Visa’s IPO. The estimations reveal a decrease ranging between 5 and 10 basis points in MasterCard’s rates subsequent to Visa’s IPO.},

This study provides the first national, quantitative assessment of the role of administrative burdens in driving this drop in child health insurance coverage. In addition, we identify the demographic groups of children who were most affected. We show that regulations that increased administrative burdens placed on families reduced public health insurance coverage by a mean of 5.9\% within six months following the implementation of these changes. Declines were largest for Hispanic children, children with non-citizen parents, and children whose parents reported that they did not speak English well. These reductions were separate from and in addition to enrollment declines among Hispanic children following the announcement of a new public charge rule in Sept. 2018.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of specification choices on the accuracy of estimates in difference-in-differences (DID) models.
DATA SOURCES: Process-of-care quality data from Hospital Compare between 2003 and 2009.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a Monte Carlo simulation experiment to estimate the effect of an imaginary policy on quality. The experiment was performed for three different scenarios in which the probability of treatment was (1) unrelated to pre-intervention performance; (2) positively correlated with pre-intervention levels of performance; and (3) positively correlated with pre-intervention trends in performance. We estimated alternative DID models that varied with respect to the choice of data intervals, the comparison group, and the method of obtaining inference. We assessed estimator bias as the mean absolute deviation between estimated program effects and their true value. We evaluated the accuracy of inferences through statistical power and rates of false rejection of the null hypothesis.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Performance of alternative specifications varied dramatically when the probability of treatment was correlated with pre-intervention levels or trends. In these cases, propensity score matching resulted in much more accurate point estimates. The use of permutation tests resulted in lower false rejection rates for the highly biased estimators, but the use of clustered standard errors resulted in slightly lower false rejection rates for the matching estimators.
CONCLUSIONS: When treatment and comparison groups differed on pre-intervention levels or trends, our results supported specifications for DID models that include matching for more accurate point estimates and models using clustered standard errors or permutation tests for better inference. Based on our findings, we propose a checklist for DID analysis.},

	abstract = {Objective To define confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies and compare regression- and matching-based estimators designed to correct bias due to observed confounders. Data sources We simulated data from linear models that incorporated different confounding relationships: time-invariant covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome, time-varying covariates with a constant effect on the outcome, and time-varying covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome. We considered a simple setting that is common in the applied literature: treatment is introduced at a single time point and there is no unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity. Study design We compared the bias and root mean squared error of treatment effect estimates from six model specifications, including simple linear regression models and matching techniques. Data collection Simulation code is provided for replication. Principal findings Confounders in difference-in-differences are covariates that change differently over time in the treated and comparison group or have a time-varying effect on the outcome. When such a confounding variable is measured, appropriately adjusting for this confounder (ie, including the confounder in a regression model that is consistent with the causal model) can provide unbiased estimates with optimal SE. However, when a time-varying confounder is affected by treatment, recovering an unbiased causal effect using difference-in-differences is difficult. Conclusions Confounding in difference-in-differences is more complicated than in cross-sectional settings, from which techniques and intuition to address observed confounding cannot be imported wholesale. Instead, analysts should begin by postulating a causal model that relates covariates, both time-varying and those with time-varying effects on the outcome, to treatment. This causal model will then guide the specification of an appropriate analytical model (eg, using regression or matching) that can produce unbiased treatment effect estimates. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful incorporation of covariates to address confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies.},

However, the corresponding algorithms are underused due to the complexity of estimating the identifying functionals they output. In this work, we bridge the gap between identiﬁcation and estimation of population-level causal eﬀects involving a single treatment and a single outcome. We derive inﬂuence function based estimators that exhibit double robustness for the identiﬁed eﬀects in a large class of hidden variable DAGs where the treatment satisﬁes a simple graphical criterion; this class includes models yielding the adjustment and front-door functionals as special cases. We also provide necessary and suﬃcient conditions under which the statistical model of a hidden variable DAG is nonparametrically saturated and implies no equality constraints on the observed data distribution. Further, we derive an important class of hidden variable DAGs that imply observed data distributions observationally equivalent (up to equality constraints) to fully observed DAGs. In these classes of DAGs, we derive estimators that achieve the semiparametric eﬃciency bounds for the target of interest where the treatment satisﬁes our graphical criterion. Finally, we provide a sound and complete identiﬁcation algorithm that directly yields a weight based estimation strategy for any identiﬁable eﬀect in hidden variable causal models.},

Most research into the impact of these laws is dated or potentially confounded by coenacted naloxone access laws. Lack of awareness and trust in GSL protections, as well as fear of police involvement and legal repercussions, remain key deterrents to help-seeking. These barriers may be unequally distributed by race/ethnicity due to racist policing and drug policies, potentially producing racial/ethnic disparities in the effectiveness of GSLs for reducing overdose mortality. We used 2015–2019 vital statistics data to estimate the effect of recent GSLs on overdose mortality, overall (8 states) and by Black/White race/ethnicity (4 states). Given GSLs’ near ubiquity, few unexposed states were available for comparison. Therefore, we generated an “inverted” synthetic control method (SCM) to compare overdose mortality in new-GSL states with that in states that had GSLs throughout the analytical period. The estimated relationships between GSLs and overdose mortality, both overall and stratified by Black/White race/ethnicity, were consistent with chance. An absence of effect could result from insufficient protection provided by the laws, insufficient awareness of them, and/or reticence to summon help not addressable by legal protections. The inverted SCM may be useful for evaluating other widespread policies.},

A common nonrandomized alternative is to compare outcomes in the treated unit(s) with unexposed controls both before and after the intervention. However, the validity of these designs depends on the use of controls that closely resemble the treated unit on before-intervention characteristics and trends on the outcome, and suitable controls may be difficult to find because the number of potential control regions is typically limited. The synthetic control method provides a potential solution to these problems by using a data-driven algorithm to identify an optimal weighted control unit—a “synthetic control”—based on data from before the intervention from available control units. While popular in the social sciences, the method has not garnered as much attention in health research, perhaps due to a lack of accessible texts aimed at health researchers. We address this gap by providing a comprehensive, nontechnical tutorial on the synthetic control method, using a worked example evaluating Florida’s “stand your ground” law to illustrate methodological and practical considerations.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid Expansion Program influences healthcare use by increasing insurance coverage. Of particular interest is how this will affect inefficient and expensive emergency department (ED) visits. We estimated the impact of the Medicaid expansion on ED use by states and payer (Medicaid, private insurance, and uninsured) 5 years after the implementation of the Medicaid expansion and illustrated the use of the generalized synthetic control method.
Methods
In this quasi-experiment study, we implemented the generalized synthetic control method to compare states with Medicaid expansion and states without Medicaid expansion. Data were from the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project Fast Stats, which cover {\textgreater}95\% of all ED visits. We included states with complete data from 2010 to 2018.
Results
Overall, the Medicaid expansion increased Medicaid share of ED visits (average treatment effect on the treated [ATT] 11.39\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 8.76-14.02) and decreased private share of ED visits (ATT −5.80\%; 95\% CI −7.40 to −4.12) and uninsured share of ED visits (ATT −6.66\%; 95\% CI −9.78 to −3.55).
Conclusions
Medicaid Expansion Program shifted ED payer mix to Medicaid ED visits from private insurance and uninsured ED visits for adults at age of 19 to 64 years, whereas its effect on total ED volume is mixed among states. States that experienced the largest increase in Medicaid enrollment seem to experience an increase in ED visits although such results did not reach statistical significance.},

	abstract = {Staggered adoption of policies by different units at different times creates promising opportunities for observational causal inference. Estimation remains challenging, however, and common regression methods can give misleading results. A promising alternative is the synthetic control method (SCM), which finds a weighted average of control units that closely balances the treated unit’s pre-treatment outcomes. In this paper, we generalize SCM, originally designed to study a single treated unit, to the staggered adoption setting. We first bound the error for the average effect and show that it depends on both the imbalance for each treated unit separately and the imbalance for the average of the treated units. We then propose ‘partially pooled’ SCM weights to minimize a weighted combination of these measures; approaches that focus only on balancing one of the two components can lead to bias. We extend this approach to incorporate unit-level intercept shifts and auxiliary covariates. We assess the performance of the proposed method via extensive simulations and apply our results to the question of whether teacher collective bargaining leads to higher school spending, finding minimal impacts. We implement the proposed method in the augsynth R package.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a widespread consensus has emerged about the necessity of establishing bridges between quantitative and qualitative approaches to empirical research in political science. In this article, we discuss the use of the synthetic control method as a way to bridge the quantitative/qualitative divide in comparative politics. The synthetic control method provides a systematic way to choose comparison units in comparative case studies. This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches. Borrowing the expression from Sidney Tarrow, the synthetic control method allows researchers to put “qualitative flesh on quantitative bones.” We illustrate the main ideas behind the synthetic control method by estimating the economic impact of the 1990 German reunification on West Germany.},

	abstract = {Building on an idea in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), this article investigates the application of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies. We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

In this paper, we propose a method that not only relaxes this often-violated assumption, but also unifies the synthetic control method (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010) with linear fixed effects models under a simple framework, of which DID is a special case. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method has several advantages. First, it allows the treatment to be correlated with unobserved unit and time heterogeneities under reasonable modeling assumptions. Second, it generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and interpretability. Third, with a built-in cross-validation procedure, it avoids specification searches and thus is easy to implement. An empirical example of Election Day Registration and voter turnout in the United States is provided.},

	abstract = {Difference-in-difference (DD) methods are a common strategy for evaluating the effects of policies or programs that are instituted at a particular point in time, such as the implementation of a new law. The DD method compares changes over time in a group unaffected by the policy intervention to the changes over time in a group affected by the policy intervention, and attributes the “difference-in-differences” to the effect of the policy. DD methods provide unbiased effect estimates if the trend over time would have been the same between the intervention and comparison groups in the absence of the intervention. However, a concern with DD models is that the program and intervention groups may differ in ways that would affect their trends over time, or their compositions may change over time. Propensity score methods are commonly used to handle this type of confounding in other non-experimental studies, but the particular considerations when using them in the context of a DD model have not been well investigated. In this paper, we describe the use of propensity scores in conjunction with DD models, in particular investigating a propensity score weighting strategy that weights the four groups (defined by time and intervention status) to be balanced on a set of characteristics. We discuss the conceptual issues associated with this approach, including the need for caution when selecting variables to include in the propensity score model, particularly given the multiple time point nature of the analysis. We illustrate the ideas and method with an application estimating the effects of a new payment and delivery system innovation (an accountable care organization model called the “Alternative Quality Contract” (AQC) implemented by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts) on health plan enrollee out-of-pocket mental health service expenditures. We find no evidence that the AQC affected out-of-pocket mental health service expenditures of enrollees.},

Nursing home CON laws have historically been the most prevalent and often most restrictive CON law. This paper explores why these nursing home regulations are so widespread by building on previous models of interstate competition. Our model predicts that repealing these laws will increase Medicaid expenditures, as well as the quality and quantity of nursing home services. We assess the predictions of our model by analyzing the repeal of nursing home CON laws in Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Dakota. Using the synthetic difference-in-differences method, we ﬁnd that repealing these regulations increased per capita nursing home Medicaid expenditures by \$102 (70\%) and \$49 (38\%) in Pennsylvania and Indiana, respectively. We also ﬁnd that this repeal caused an increase in the quantity of nursing home beds, nursing home facilities, and specialized care beds, most notably in Pennsylvania. Our ﬁndings and theoretical framework are consistent with the proposition that interstate competition incentivizes politicians to impose more restrictive nursing home CON laws than they would in the absence of such competition. We argue that such competitive pressures are an artifact of Medicaid and offer alternatives to the current system.},

This assumption is implausible in many settings. An alternative assumption is that the potential outcomes are independent of treatment status, conditional on past outcomes. This paper considers three methods that share this assumption: the synthetic control method, a lagged dependent variable (LDV) regression approach, and matching on past outcomes. Our motivating empirical study is an evaluation of a hospital pay-for-performance scheme in England, the best practice tariffs programme. The conclusions of the original DiD analysis are sensitive to the choice of approach. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study that investigates these methods’ performance. While DiD produces unbiased estimates when the parallel trends assumption holds, the alternative approaches provide less biased estimates of treatment effects when it is violated. In these cases, the LDV approach produces the most efﬁcient and least biased estimates.},

Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method's assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.},

We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Extensions include time-varying controls, triple-differences, and certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of these insights in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the United States, we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11 percent in the first quarter -- about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models -- and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.},

We tested five methods under a range of missing data scenarios. Logical and demographic imputation methods yielded biased estimates across all missing data scenarios. Statistical imputation approaches yielded unbiased estimates only when unauthorized status was jointly observed with insurance coverage; when this condition was not met, these methods overestimated insurance coverage for unauthorized relative to legal immigrants. We next showed how bias can be reduced by incorporating prior information about unauthorized immigrants. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of the best-performing statistical method for increasing power. We used it to produce state/regional estimates of insurance coverage among unauthorized immigrants in the Current Population Survey, a data source that contains no direct measures of immigrants’ legal status.

This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis – with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates – can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption. Further, the two-way Mundlak regression is easily adapted to nonlinear models such as exponential models and logit and probit models.},

However, it is not clear whether the reform has had an equally meaningful effect with respect to underinsurance, which is the state of having health insurance yet lacking adequate coverage or facing substantial financial risks upon usage of services. Based on a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences approach, we analyzed the data from a nationally representative sample to estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on the probability of underinsurance among the non-elderly low-income adult population of the U.S. We found no evidence of significant changes in the likelihood of underinsurance due to Medicaid expansion during the first 4 years after the ACA implementation. However, a supplementary analysis of the longer-term impact (2018-2019) suggests that there might be a time lag between Medicaid expansion and its effect on underinsurance. It is important to realize that expansion of coverage alone may not be sufficient to protect millions of Americans, particularly those with low incomes, from underinsurance. It is, therefore, crucial for policymakers to build legislative frameworks that protect individuals from excessive healthcare expenses and prevent treatment avoidance or delay.},

Second, stay-at-home orders caused large reductions in spending in sectors associated with mobility: small businesses and large retail chains. Third, we estimate fairly uniform responses to stay-at-home orders across the country; effects do not vary by county-level income, political leanings, or urban/rural status.},

Our study overcomes these limitations by evaluating twenty years of Medicaid expansions across the entire United States. We obtain data from the U.S. Census Bureau for all U.S. states and D.C. for private insurance coverage rates of adults 18-64, for years 1999-2019. After estimating a naïve, staggered Two-Way Fixed Effects Difference-in-Differences regression model, we implement four novel econometric methods to diagnose and overcome threats of bias from staggered designs. We also test for pre-treatment differential trends and heterogenous effects over time. Our findings suggest that Medicaid expansion was associated with a 1.5\%-point decline in private insurance rates (p {\textless} 0.001). We also observe significant heterogeneity over time, with estimates peaking four years after expansion. The importance of a 1-2\% point crowd-out, we leave for future research and debate.},

Methods. Data came from the 2013 Uniform Data System for colorectal and cervical cancer screening rates among patients of federally qualiﬁed health centers (FQHCs); the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer screening rates; and the US Cancer Statistics (2007–2011) for colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer mortality-toincidence ratios (MIRs). Dyads of Medicaid expansion decisions with cancer screening rates and MIRs were mapped using ArcMap.
Results. States that had not expanded Medicaid as of September 2014 had lower cancer screening rates, especially among FQHC patients. Overall, cancer MIRs were not signiﬁcantly different by Medicaid expansion status. However, Southeastern states without Medicaid expansion tended to have higher cancer MIRs and lower screening rates.
Conclusions. Disparities in cancer screening that already disfavor states with high cancer rates may widen in states that have not chosen to expand Medicaid unless signiﬁcant efforts are mounted to ensure their residents obtain preventive health care.

They suggest that this observed pre diffrence in Cancer disparities could widen the disparities between the expanded and non expanded states.
They discuss using MIR statistic instead of mortality and incidence to study disparities, which could be useful for the later papers. There are two things I don't like about this paper. First, they repeatedly mention that the disparity would widen in states that did not expand Medicaid, but I'm not fond of their explanation. Second, I did not appreciate their statistical method explanation.I might use their MIR statistics idea for later studies, but I guess, for now, I have to drop this from the bibliography.},

We conducted a systematic review of relevant literature on this topic, analyzing twenty-four studies published between January 2014 and April 2021. We found that the ACA Medicaid expansion increased preconception and postpartum Medicaid coverage with corresponding declines in uninsurance, private insurance coverage, and insurance churn. There was limited evidence that Medicaid expansion increased perinatal health care use or improved infant birth outcomes overall, although some studies reported reduced racial and ethnic disparities in rates of prenatal and postpartum visit attendance, maternal mortality, low birthweight, and preterm births. Stronger data collection on preconception and postpartum outcomes with sufficient sample sizes to stratify by race and ethnicity is needed to assess the full impact of the ACA and emerging Medicaid policy changes, such as the postpartum Medicaid extension.},

Study Design We identified relevant articles from peer-reviewed scholarly journals by performing a comprehensive search of major electronic databases. We also identified reports in the “gray literature” disseminated by government agencies and other organizations. Principal Findings Overall, research shows that the ACA has substantially decreased the number of uninsured individuals through the dependent coverage provision, Medicaid expansion, health insurance exchanges, availability of subsidies, and other policy changes. Affordability of health insurance continues to be a concern for many people and disparities persist by geography, race/ethnicity, and income. Early evidence also indicates improvements in access to and affordability of health care. All of these changes are certain to ultimately impact state and federal budgets. Conclusions The ACA will either directly or indirectly affect almost all Americans. As new and comprehensive data become available, more rigorous evaluations will provide further insights as to whether the ACA has been successful in achieving its goals.},

In this article, we discuss seven ACA provisions with regard to their intended and realized impact on social inequalities in health, focusing primarily on socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities. Arriving at its 10th anniversary, there is significant evidence that the ACA has reduced social disparities in key health care outcomes, including insurance coverage, health care access, and the use of primary care. In addition, the ACA has had a significant impact on the volume/range of services offered and the financial security of community health centers, and through section 1557, the ACA broadened the civil rights landscape in which the health care system operates. Less clear is how the ACA has contributed to improved health outcomes and health equity. Extant evidence suggests that the part of the ACA that has had the greatest impact on social disparities in health outcomes—including preterm births and mortality—is the Medicaid expansion.},

This secondary analysis of birth records examines whether immigrants and mothers from refugee countries have lower adjusted risk of preterm births than US-born mothers in Syracuse, NY, a preferred refugee resettlement area. Methods This secondary analysis included 6354 electronic birth records for residents in the city of Syracuse, NY who gave birth to singleton infants between 2009 and 2011. Multivariate log-binomial regression was used to calculate the adjusted relative risk for preterm birth among foreign-born mothers and mothers from refugee countries, compared to US-born mothers. Results Infants born to both foreign-born women and to women from refugee countries had decreased risks of being born preterm compared to infants born to US mothers, controlling for race, late/no prenatal care, maternal age less than 18 years and smoking. Conclusion Our findings support a healthy immigrant effect for preterm births both among all foreign-born immigrants and among the subsample of women from refugee countries. Mother’s nativity is likely a proxy for unmeasured factors (e.g., prenatal stress, maternal diet, etc.) that may explain the relationship between mother’s nativity and preterm births.

	abstract = {Introduction
Medicaid expansions following the Affordable Care Act have improved insurance coverage in low-income adults, but little is known about its impact on cancer screening. This study examined associations between Medicaid expansion timing and colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) screening.
Methods
Up-to-date and past 2-year CRC (n=95,400) and BC (women, n=43,279) screening prevalence were computed among low-income respondents aged 50–64 years in 2012, 2014, and 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. Respondents were grouped according to Medicaid expansion timing as: very early ([VE] six states expanding March 1, 2010–April 14, 2011), early (21 states expanding January 1, 2014–August 15, 2014), late (five states expanding January 1, 2015–July 1, 2016), and non-expansion states (19 states). Absolute adjusted difference-in-differences (aDDs) were computed in 2018–2019 (ref, non-expansion states).
Results
Between 2012 and 2016, absolute up-to-date CRC screening increased by 8.8\%, 2.9\%, 2.4\%, and 3.8\% among low-income adults in VE, early, late, and non-expansion states, respectively. Past 2–year CRC screening increased by 8.0\% in VE and 2.8\% in non-expansion states, with an aDD of 4.9\% (p=0.041). In 2012–2016, up-to-date BC screening increased by 5.1\%, 4.9\%, and 3.7\% among low-income women in VE, early, and non-expansion states, respectively, but aDDs were not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Prevalence of CRC and BC screening among low-income adults rose in Medicaid expansion states, though increases were significantly higher than those in non-expansion states only for recent CRC screening in VE expansion states. Large-scale improvements in cancer screening may take several years following expansion in access to care.},

This study's objective was to compare the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke among US adults by birthplace.

Methods and Results

We used data from the 2006 to 2014 National Health Interview Survey. Birthplace was categorized as United States or foreign born. Foreign born was then grouped into 6 birthplace regions. We defined CHD and stroke as ever being told by a physician that she or he had CHD or stroke. We adjusted for select demographic and health characteristics in the analysis. Of US adults, 16\% were classified as foreign born. Age‐standardized prevalence of both CHD and stroke were higher among US‐ than foreign‐born adults (CHD: 8.2\% versus 5.5\% for men and 4.8\% versus 4.1\% for women; stroke: 2.7\% versus 2.1\% for men and 2.7\% versus 1.9\% for women; all P{\textless}0.05). Comparing individual regions with those of US‐ born adults, CHD prevalence was lower among foreign‐born adults from Asia and Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean. For stroke, although men from South America or Africa had the lowest prevalence, women from Europe had the lowest prevalence. Years of living in the United States was not related to risk of CHD or stroke after adjustment with demographic and health characteristics.

Conclusions

Overall, foreign‐born adults residing in the United States had a lower prevalence of CHD and stroke than US‐born adults. However, considerable heterogeneity of CHD and stroke risk was found by region of birth.},

Non-US-born African Black women were less likely to have breast cancer screening, compared to US-born Black women. Among non-US-born Black women, non-US-born Caribbean Black women were more likely to have had breast cancer screening. Differential healthcare access associated with nativity differences among Black women can be informing their breast cancer screening behaviors. Efforts to improve breast cancer outcomes among Black women can benefit from interventions that account for differential access to healthcare and breast cancer screening behaviors among subgroups of Black women.},

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are used to reduce the effects of observed confounding when using observational data to estimate the effects of treatments or exposures. A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received. These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding. Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes. However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error. In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment. We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a naïve model‐based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich‐type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator. We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated. We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates. The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates. Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality. © 2016 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Using 171 million person-months spanning 73 employers from 2008–2014, we estimate that the overall demand elasticity by backward myopic consumers is −0.44, with high elasticities of demand for pharmaceuticals (−0.44), specialists visits (−0.32), MRIs (−0.29) and mental health/substance abuse (−0.26), and lower elasticities for prevention visits (−0.02), and emergency rooms (−0.04).

To adjust for pre-expansion differences in mortality rates between treatment and control, we use a propensity-score weighting model together with techniques from machine learning to match counties in expansion and non-expansion states. We find a reduction in all-cause mortality in ages 20 to 64 equaling 11.36 deaths per 100,000 individuals, a 3.6 percent decrease. This estimate is largely driven by reductions in mortality in counties with higher pre-expansion uninsured rates and for causes of death likely to be influenced by access to healthcare. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the improvement in welfare due to mortality responses may offset the entire net-of-transfers expenditure associated with the expansion.},

We estimated propensity score weighted difference-in-difference (DID) models to test for differences in preventive services utilization based on Medicare insurance status.

We aim to provide an overview of methods and their performance assessed by simulation studies indexed in PubMed. We searched PubMed for simulation studies published until January 2021. Our search was restricted to studies evaluating binary treatments and binary and/or continuous outcomes. Information was extracted on the methods' assumptions, performance, and technical properties. Of 28,548 identified references, 127 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of them, 84 assessed 14 different methods (ie, groups of estimators that share assumptions and implementation) for dealing with measured confounding, and 43 assessed 10 different methods for dealing with unmeasured confounding. Results suggest that there are large differences in performance between methods and that the performance of a specific method is highly dependent on the estimator. Furthermore, the methods' assumptions regarding the specific data features also substantially influence the methods' performance. Finally, the methods result in different estimands (ie, target of inference), which can even vary within methods. In conclusion, when choosing a method to adjust for measured or unmeasured confounding it is important to choose the most appropriate estimand, while considering the population of interest, data structure, and whether the plausibility of the methods' required assumptions hold.},

	abstract = {Context
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act increases healthcare access and includes provisions that directly impact access to and cost of evidence-based colorectal cancer screening. The Affordable Care Act's removal of cost sharing for colorectal cancer screening as well as Medicaid expansion have been hypothesized to increase screening and improve other health outcomes. However, since its passage in 2010, there is little consensus on the Affordable Care Act's impact.
Evidence acquisition
Data from March 2010 to June 2019 were reviewed and 21 relevant studies were identified; 19 studies examined colorectal cancer screening with most finding increased screening rates.
Evidence synthesis
Eleven studies found significant increases, 5 found nonsignificant increases, 3 found nonsignificant decreases, and 1 study found a significant decrease in colorectal cancer screening. Three studies examined the impact on colorectal cancer incidence and stage of diagnosis, where a significant 2.4\% increase in early diagnosis was found in one and a nonsignificant increase in incidence in another. However, survival improved after Medicaid expansion.
Conclusions
Free preventive colorectal cancer screening and Medicaid expansion because of passage of the Affordable Care Act have been, in general, positively associated with modest improvements in screening rates across the country. Future studies are needed that investigate the longer-term impact of the Affordable Care Act on colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality rates, as screening is only the first step in treatment of cancerous and precancerous lesions, preventing them from progressing. Moreover, more studies examining subpopulations are needed to better assess where gaps in care remain.},

We used generalized estimating equations and difference-in-differences tests to assess the effects of insurance gain on: (1) change in PS utilization, and (2) reduction in utilization disparities between USB and FB adults, adjusting for predisposing, health enabling, and health needs factors. Our results showed that newly-insured FB adults substantially increased their use of all primary care checks, and exercise and diet advice. We also found improvements in use of endoscopies, two modalities of colon cancer screening, and prostate cancer screening, but not in receipt of mammography and clinical breast exams. Newly-insured FB PS use remained lower than use among continuously-insured USB adults, but some of the differences were explained by adjustment to enabling and health needs factors. Briefly, health insurance gains among immigrants translated into substantial improvements in use of recommended PS. Still, notable disparities persist among the newly-insured FB, and more so among the 1 in 5 that remain continuously uninsured.},

Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and a difference-in-differences model that compares states that did and did not expand Medicaid, we examine the impact of the expansions on preventive care (e.g., dental visits, immunizations, mammograms, cancer screenings), risky health behaviors (e.g., smoking, heavy drinking, lack of exercise, obesity), and self-assessed health. We find that the expansions increased insurance coverage and access to care among the targeted population of low-income childless adults. The expansions also increased use of certain forms of preventive care, but there is no evidence that they increased ex ante moral hazard (i.e., there is no evidence that risky health behaviors increased in response to health insurance coverage). The Medicaid expansions also modestly improved self-assessed health.},

This paradox disappears as immigrants stay longer in the host country. Multiple arguments, including migrant selectivity and cultural and behavioral factors have been proposed as reasons for the apparent paradox. Recently, the field has focused on immigrant legal status, especially its racialization. We review the literature on the immigrant health paradox, legal status, and racialized legal status to examine how this debate has taken a more structural approach. We find that immigrant health research has taken a needed intersectional approach, a productive development that examines how different markers of disadvantage work concurrently to shape immigrants’ health. This approach, which factors in immigration enforcement practices, aligns with explanations for poor health outcomes among other racialized groups, and promises a fruitful avenue for future research.},

	abstract = {Context: Acute complications are responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality of patients with diabetes. Health insurance increases access to needed healthcare and receipt of diabetes-related preventive care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid eligibility provision was enacted in 2014 with the goal of expanding coverage to all US citizens and legal residents. The ACA led to improvement in healthcare access and health outcomes among patients with diabetes.
Objective: To understand whether patients with diabetes in states that expanded Medicaid had greater reductions in the rate of acute complications post-ACA than those in states that did not expand Medicaid.
Study Design: Retrospective observational cohort study.
Setting or Dataset: Electronic health record data: 274 community health centers from the Accelerating Data Value Across a National Community Health Center Network clinical research network.
Population Studied: Non-pregnant adults (n=5,176) aged 19-64 without Medicare coverage history, newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2013 with ≥1 visit in each of the following periods: 2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2019.
Outcome Measures: Rates of acute complications identified using ICD-9/10-CM codes and counted distinctly if the interval between each diagnosis was at least 10 days. Patients’ annual acute complication rates were compared using a covariate-adjusted GEE Poisson model clustering on patients assuming an exchangeable working correlation. Outcome trends over time between expansion and non-expansion states were tested using interaction terms for time and expansion status.
Results: From 2013 through 2019, annual acute complication rates declined overall for patients in both expansion (2013: 0.35; 2019: 0.18) and non-expansion (2013: 0.13; 2019: 0.10) states, with higher observed rates of acute complications in expansion (compared to non-expansion) states throughout the study period. Trends in acute complication rates were not parallel over time between expansion and non-expansion states (p{\textless}0.01), with a larger decline in expansion (compared to non-expansion) states immediately following the ACA (relative rate change from 2013 to 2015: -41\% in expansion vs -1\% in non-expansion).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that increased access to health insurance following the ACA was associated with a reduction in acute complications among patients with diabetes in states that expanded Medicaid.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the extent, predictors and consequences of disparities between self-reported and measured obesity in a young population. Past research has shown the relevance of both self-reported and measured health as the outcome of interest or as a key predictor of other important variables like labor force participation, retirement decisions of workers etc. These studies however have produced mixed results of the determinants of health and its role as a predictor of other economic outcomes, with results frequently differing by the choice of health measure used measured versus selfreported. Although objective/measured and subjective/self-reported health should essentially reflect the same thing there is ample evidence in past literature of large disparities between the two health measures in even very high quality surveys. These differences raise several questions: What is the extent of the disparity between objective and subjective health? Are there any consistent predictors of these differences that can be used to reconcile these differences? What are the consequences of the disparity between self-reported and measured health for economic models? Focussing on hypertension and obesity, which together with their co-morbidities are the two biggest ‘killers’ of our time, this study attempts to answer precisely these questions.

However, little research has assessed how changes in cancer stage may mediate improved cancer mortality or how expansion may have decreased population-level cancer mortality rates.Nationwide state-level cancer data from 2001 to 2019 for individuals ages 20-64 years were obtained from the combined Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results National Program of Cancer Registries (incidence) and the National Center for Health Statistics (mortality) databases. We estimated changes in distant stage cancer incidence and cancer mortality rates from pre- to post-2014 in expansion vs nonexpansion states using generalized estimating equations with robust standard errors. Mediation analyses were used to assess whether distant stage cancer incidence mediated changes in cancer mortality.There were 17 370 state-level observations. For all cancers combined, there were Medicaid expansion–associated decreases in distant stage cancer incidence (adjusted odds ratio = 0.967, 95\% confidence interval  = 0.943 to 0.992; P = .01) and cancer mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 0.965, 95\% confidence interval = 0.936 to 0.995; P = .022). This translates to 2591 averted distant stage cancer diagnoses and 1616 averted cancer deaths in the Medicaid expansion states. Distant stage cancer incidence mediated 58.4\% of expansion-associated changes in cancer mortality overall (P = .008). By cancer site subgroups, there were expansion-associated decreases in breast, cervix, and liver cancer mortality.Medicaid expansion was associated with decreased distant stage cancer incidence and cancer mortality. Approximately 60\% of the expansion-associated changes in cancer mortality overall were mediated by distant stage diagnoses.},

	abstract = {Background
In 2014, only 26 states and D.C. chose to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions for low-income adults.

Objective
To estimate whether the state Medicaid expansions were associated with changes in insurance coverage, access to and utilization of health care, and self-reported health.

Design
Comparison of outcomes before and after the expansions in states that did and did not expand Medicaid.

Setting
U.S.

Participants
Citizens aged 19–64 with family incomes below 138\% of the Federal Poverty Level in the 2010–2014 National Health Interview Surveys.

Measurements
Health insurance coverage (private, Medicaid, uninsured); health insurance better than last year; visits with doctors in general practice and with specialists; hospitalizations and ED visits; skipped or delayed medical care; usual source of care; diagnoses of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension; self-reported health; and depression.

Results
In the second half of 2014, low-income adults in expansion states experienced increased health insurance (7.4 percentage points; 95\% CI, −11.3 to −3.4) and Medicaid (10.5 percentage points; 95\% CI, 6.5 to 14.5) coverage, and increased quality of insurance coverage compared to a year ago (7.1 percentage points; 95\% CI, 2.7 to 11.5) when compared to adults in states that did not expand Medicaid. Medicaid expansions were associated with increased visits with doctors in general practice (6.6 percentage points; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 12.0), overnight hospital stays (2.4 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.7 to 4.2), and rates of diagnosis of diabetes (5.2 percentage points; 95\% CI, 2.4 to 8.1) and high cholesterol (5.7 percentage points; 95\% CI, 2.0 to 9.4); changes in other outcomes were not statistically significant.

Limitations
Observational study may be susceptible to unmeasured confounders; relies on self-reported data; limited post-ACA timeframe provides information on short-term changes only.

Conclusions
The ACA Medicaid expansions were associated with higher rates of insurance coverage, improved quality of coverage, increased utilization of some types of health care, and higher rates of diagnosis of chronic health conditions for low-income adults.},

The main effects of the ACA include regulation of the health insurance industry, expansion of access to health care, and health care delivery system reform, which included the creation of several alternative payment models. Particular components of the ACA, such as the elimination of annual and lifetime caps on spending, Medicaid expansion, and the individual and employer mandate, could have positive effects for heart failure patients. However, the benefits of value-based and alternative payment models such as the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and bundled payment programs for heart failure outcomes are less clear, and controversy exists regarding whether some of these programs may even worsen outcomes. As the population ages and the prevalence of heart failure continues to rise, this syndrome will likely remain a key clinical focus for policymakers. Therefore, heart failure clinicians should be aware of how legislation affects clinical practice and be prepared to adapt to continued changes in health policy.},

	doi = {10.1080/13557858.2016.1246518},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Immigrants are typically healthier than the native-born population in the receiving country and also tend to be healthier than non-migrants in the countries of origin. This foreign-born health advantage has been referred to as the healthy immigrant effect (HIE). We examined evidence for the HIE in Canada.
DESIGN: We employed a systematic search of the literature on immigration and health and identified 78 eligible studies. We used a narrative method to synthesize the HIE across different stages of the life-course and different health outcomes within each stage. We also examined the empirical evidence for positive selection and duration effects - two common explanations of migrants' health advantage and deterioration, respectively.
RESULTS: We find that the HIE appears to be strongest during adulthood but less so during childhood/adolescence and late life. A foreign-born health advantage is also more robust for mortality but less so for morbidity. The HIE is also stronger for more recent immigrants but further research is needed to determine the critical threshold for when migrants' advantage disappears. Positive selection as an explanation for the HIE remains underdeveloped.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an absence of a uniform foreign-born health advantage across different life-course stages and health outcomes in Canada. Nonetheless, it remains the case that the HIE characterizes the majority of contemporary migrants since Canada's foreign-born population consists mostly of core working age adults.},

	abstract = {Background:
Disparities in health outcomes between immigrant and native-origin populations, particularly pregnant women, pose significant challenges to healthcare systems. The aim of this systematic-review and meta-analysis was to investigate the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes among immigrant-women compared to native-origin women in the host country.

Methods:
PubMed (including MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to retrieve studies published in English language up to September 2020. All observational studies examining the prevalence of at least one of the short-term single pregnancy outcomes for immigrants who crossed international borders compared to native-origin pregnant population were included. The meta-prop method was used for the pooled-estimation of adverse pregnancy-outcomes’ prevalence. For pool-effect estimates, the association between the immigration-status and outcomes of interest, the random-effects model was applied using the model described by DerSimonian and Laird. I2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. The publication bias was assessed using the Harbord-test. Meta-regression was performed to explore the effect of geographical region as the heterogeneity source.

Findings:
This review involved 11 320 674 pregnant women with an immigration-background and 56 102 698 pregnant women as the native-origin population. The risk of emergency cesarean section (Pooled-OR = 1.1, 95\%CI = 1.0–1.2), shoulder dystocia (Pooled-OR = 1.1, 95\%CI = 1.0–1.3), gestational diabetes mellites (Pooled-OR = 1.4, 95\%CI = 1.2–1.6), small for gestational age (Pooled-OR=1.3, 95\%CI = 1.1–0.4), 5-min Apgar less than 7 (Pooled-OR = 1.2, 95\%CI = 1.0–1.3) and oligohydramnios (Pooled-OR = 1.8, 95\%CI = 1.0–3.3) in the immigrant women were significantly higher than those with the native origin background. The immigrant women had a lower risk of labor induction (Pooled-OR = 0.8, 95\%CI = 0.7–0.8), pregnancy induced hypertension (Pooled-OR = 0.6, 95\%CI = 0.5–0.7) preeclampsia (Pooled-OR = 0.7, 95\%CI = 0.6–0.8), macrosomia (Pooled-OR = 0.8, 95\%CI = 0.7–0.9) and large for gestational age (Pooled-OR = 0.8, 95\%CI = 0.7–0.8). Also, the risk of total and primary cesarean section, instrumental-delivery, preterm-birth, and birth-trauma were similar in both groups. According to meta-regression analyses, the reported ORs were not influenced by the country of origin.

Conclusion:
The relationship between the immigration status and adverse perinatal outcomes indicated a heterogenous pattern, but the immigrant women were at an increased risk of some important adverse pregnancy outcomes. Population-based studies with a focus on the various aspects of this phenomena are required to explain the source of these heterogenicities.},

Many previous studies have suggested this advantage reflects higher levels of social support among Mexicans in enclave communities with high co-ethnic density. As the Mexican-origin population in the US has grown, it has expanded outside traditional gateway cities in California and Texas to new destinations throughout the US, and it has become increasingly important to understand how settlement in new destinations impacts the health of Mexican immigrants. This study examines the mortality outcomes of Mexican immigrants in Traditional Gateways versus New and Minor Destinations in the US. Using a nationally-representative survey with mortality follow-up the analysis finds that Mexican immigrants in new and minor destinations have a significant survival advantage over their counterparts in traditional gateways. This advantage largely reflects the mortality benefits of living in communities with smaller and less-established Mexicans immigrant communities, a finding that runs in contrast to prior work on the protective effects of immigrant enclaves. The results suggest that future research must reevaluate the relationship between neighborhood ethnic composition, social support, and immigrant health.},

Using data from the 2000–2007 National Health Interview Surveys, we compare health outcomes among immigrants to those among U.S.-born whites and assess gender differences within each group. We find an immigrant story and a gender story. Mexican and Middle Eastern immigrants are healthier than U.S.-born whites, and men report better health than women regardless of nativity or ethnicity. We identify utilization of health care as a primary mechanism that contributes to both patterns. Immigrants are less likely than U.S.-born whites to interact with the health care system, and women are more likely to do so than men. Thus, immigrant and gender health disparities may partly reflect knowledge of health status rather than actual health.},

	abstract = {The increasingly pervasive practice of veiling among Muslim women has stimulated a great deal of scholarly investigation and debate. This study brings empirical evidence to bear on current debates about the meaning of the veil in Islam. This article first examines the conflicting meanings of the veil among Muslim religious elites and Islamic feminists. Although the dominant gender discourse among Muslim elites strongly favors this cultural practice, an antiveiling discourse promulgated by Islamic feminists has gained ground within recent years. This study then examines how these discursive disputes affect gender identity negotiation among veiled and unveiled Muslim women living in Austin, Texas. Interviews with these women highlight how their gender identities reproduce and reformulate existing Muslim gender discourses. Special attention is paid to the subjective disparities and points of congruence between both groups of respondents. This study concludes by suggesting avenues for future research on the intersection of gender, religion, and cultural difference.},

	abstract = {There has been a great deal of state-level legislative activity focused on immigration and immigrants over the past decade in the United States. Some policies aim to improve access to education, transportation, benefits, and additional services while others constrain such access. From a social determinants of health perspective, social and economic policies are intrinsically health policies, but research on the relationship between state-level immigration-related policies and Latino health remains scarce. This paper summarizes the existing evidence about the range of state-level immigration policies that affect Latino health, indicates conceptually plausible but under-explored relationships between policy domains and Latino health, traces the mechanisms through which immigration policies might shape Latino health, and points to key areas for future research. We examined peer-reviewed publications from 1986 to 2016 and assessed 838 based on inclusion criteria; 40 were included for final review. These 40 articles identified four pathways through which state-level immigration policies may influence Latino health: through stress related to structural racism; by affecting access to beneficial social institutions, particularly education; by affecting access to healthcare and related services; and through constraining access to material conditions such as food, wages, working conditions, and housing. Our review demonstrates that the field of immigration policy and health is currently dominated by a “one-policy, one-level, one-outcome” approach. We argue that pursuing multi-sectoral, multi-level, and multi-outcome research will strengthen and advance the existing evidence base on immigration policy and Latino health.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) preexisting conditions provision on mental health. The 2014 policy ensured individuals with preexisting health conditions the right to obtain insurance coverage. Using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics between 2007 and 2017 and estimating difference-in-differences models, our study provides evidence that the policy reduced severe mental distress by 1.44 percentage points (baseline mean: 8.09\%) among individuals with preexisting physical health conditions. Exploiting pre-ACA, state-level variation in policies providing insurance coverage options to people with preexisting conditions, we find that this improvement in mental well-being is highly associated with the presence of high-risk pools before 2014, which provided individuals with prior health conditions access to coverage. Specifically, we show that our main results are driven by individuals with preexisting health conditions living in the 16 states that did not have high-risk pools. Furthermore, gender-specific analysis shows that the reduction in mental distress is primarily observable among women. When examining potential mechanisms, our analysis provides evidence that increases in insurance coverage, reductions in healthcare expenditures, and improvements in physical health can explain the positive effects of the provision on mental well-being.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In the United States, Latinos have poorer access to and utilization of health care than non-Latino whites. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) may reduce these disparities. The ACA's impact among Latino subgroups is unknown.
METHODS: Using the 2011 to 2015 National Health Interview Survey, we examined access to and utilization of health care by Latino subgroups (18-64 years old). Subgroups were defined by Latino heritage group, citizenship status, and language use. Measures of access and utilization included insurance status, delaying medical care, forgoing medical care, visiting the emergency department, and visiting a physician. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of the outcomes. Time period and subgroup interaction terms were used to test the effects of the ACA.
RESULTS: Mexicans and Central Americans had lower odds of being insured than did non-Latino whites. After ACA implementation, most reductions in disparities occurred between Puerto Ricans and non-Latino whites. Limited impact of the ACA was observed by language and citizenship status.
CONCLUSIONS: The ACA has reduced gaps in access to and utilization of health care for some Latino population subgroups. Remaining disparities necessitate policy solutions that move beyond the ACA, particularly for groups excluded from coverage options, such as noncitizens.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether Medicaid expansion is associated with improved mortality among patients with cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference (DID), cross-sectional, population-based study. Patients in the National Cancer Database with breast, lung, or colorectal cancer newly diagnosed from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015, were included. Data analysis was performed from January to May 2020. EXPOSURE Living in a state where Medicaid was expanded vs a nonexpansion state. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was mortality rate according to whether the patient lived in a state where Medicaid was expanded.
RESULTS A total of 523 802 patients (385 739 women [73.6\%]; mean [SD] age, 54.8 [6.5] years) had a new diagnosis of invasive breast (273 272 patients [52.2\%]), colorectal (111 720 patients [21.3\%]), or lung (138 810 patients [26.5\%]) cancer; 289 330 patients (55.2\%) lived in Medicaid expansion states, and 234 472 patients (44.8\%) lived in nonexpansion states. After Medicaid expansion, mortality significantly decreased in expansion states (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.97-0.99; P = .008) but not in nonexpansion states (HR, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.02; P = .43), resulting in a significant DID (HR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.05; P = .01). This difference was seen primarily in patients with nonmetastatic cancer (stages I-III). After adjusting for cancer stage, the mortality improvement in expansion states from the periods before and after expansion was no longer evident (HR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.02; P = .94), nor was the difference between expansion vs nonexpansion states (DID HR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.02; P = .84).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with newly diagnosed breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, Medicaid expansion was associated with a decreased hazard of mortality in the postexpansion period, which was mediated by earlier stage of diagnosis.},

Mexican Americans, the largest subgroup of US Latinos, have particularly great barriers to health care access and experience disparities in care and in health outcomes. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010 and mostly implemented by January 1, 2014, was designed in part to improve health insurance access for uninsured groups, including an option for states to expand Medicaid. We assess the ACA’s effect on six health-related outcomes for Mexican American adults (18–64 years of age). We estimate difference-in-difference models using the IPUMS National Health Interview Survey data; Mexican Americans living in the West are assigned as the treatment group (where {\textasciitilde} 97\% of Mexican Americans live in states which expanded Medicaid) and the South as a control group (where {\textasciitilde} 4\% of Mexican Americans live in states which expanded Medicaid). We designate 2010–2013 as the pre-treatment period and 2014–2018 as the post-treatment period. The results for the full sample suggest that Medicaid expansion increased Mexican Americans’ probability of having health insurance, a physician visit in the past year, and self-reported diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension; and decreased the probability of reporting self-assessed health of “very good” or “excellent.” Heterogeneity analyses suggest remarkably large gains for those who are men, foreign-born, undocumented, with less than high school levels of education, with incomes less than 100\% of the federal poverty line (FPL), and those who have lived more than 5 and less than 10 years in the USA.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The impact of Medicaid expansion on linkage to care, self-maintenance, and treatment among low-income adults with diabetes was examined.
Methods
A difference-in-differences design was used on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2008–2018. Analysis was restricted to states with diabetes outcomes and nonpregnant adults aged 18–64 years who were Medicaid eligible on the basis of income. Separate analyses were performed for early postexpansion (1, 2, 3) and late postexpansion years (4, 5). Analyses were performed from September 2019 to March 2020.
Results
In comparing expansion with control states, low-income residents with diabetes had similar ages (48.9 vs 49.1 years) and similar proportions who were female (54.4\% vs 55.0\%) but were less likely to be Black, non-Hispanic (20.8\% vs 29.2\%, standardized difference= −16.3\%). In expansion states, health insurance increased by 7.2 percentage points (95\% CI=3.9, 10.4), and the ability to afford a physician increased by 5.5 percentage points (95\% CI=1.9, 9.1) in the early years, but no difference was found in late years. Medicaid expansion led to a 5.3-percentage point increase in provider foot examinations in the early period (95\% CI=0.14, 10.4) and a 7.2-percentage point increase in self-foot examinations in the late period (95\% CI=1.1, 13.3). No statistically significant changes were detected in self-reported linkage to care, self-maintenance, or treatment.
Conclusions
Although health insurance, ability to afford a physician visit, and foot examinations increased for Medicaid-eligible people with diabetes, there was no statistically significant difference found for other care continuum measures.},

	abstract = {The effect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion on cancer care delivery and outcomes is unknown. Patients with cancer are a high-risk group for whom treatment delays are particularly detrimental.To examine the association between Medicaid expansion and changes in insurance status, stage at diagnosis, and timely treatment among patients with incident breast, colon, and non–small cell lung cancer.This quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences (DID) cross-sectional study included nonelderly adults (aged 40-64 years) with a new diagnosis of invasive breast, colon, or non–small cell lung cancer from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016, in the National Cancer Database, a hospital-based registry capturing more than 70\% of incident cancer diagnoses in the United States. Data were analyzed from March 8 to August 15, 2019.Residence in a state that expanded Medicaid on January 1, 2014.The primary outcomes were insurance status, cancer stage, and timely treatment within 30 and 90 days of diagnosis.A total of 925 543 patients (78.6\% women; mean [SD] age, 55.0 [6.5] years; 14.2\% black; and 5.7\% Hispanic) had a new diagnosis of invasive breast (58.9\%), colon (14.6\%), or non–small cell lung (26.5\%) cancer; 48.3\% resided in Medicaid expansion states and 51.7\% resided in nonexpansion states. Compared with nonexpansion states, the percentage of uninsured patients decreased more in expansion states (adjusted DID, −0.7 [95\% CI, −1.2 to −0.3] percentage points), and the percentage of early-stage cancer diagnoses rose more in expansion states (adjusted DID, 0.8 [95\% CI, 0.3 to 1.2] percentage points). Among the 848 329 patients who underwent cancer-directed therapy within 365 days of diagnosis, the percentage treated within 30 days declined from 52.7\% before to 48.0\% after expansion in expansion states (difference, −4.7 [95\% CI, −5.1 to −4.5] percentage points). In nonexpansion states, this percentage declined from 56.9\% to 51.5\% (difference, −5.4 [95\% CI, −5.6 to −5.1] percentage points), yielding no statistically significant DID in timely treatment associated with Medicaid expansion (adjusted DID, 0.6 [95\% CI, −0.2 to 1.4] percentage points).This study found that, among patients with incident breast, colon, and lung cancer, Medicaid expansion was associated with a decreased rate of uninsured patients and increased rate of early-stage cancer diagnosis; no evidence of improvement or decrement in the rate of timely treatment was found. Further research is warranted to understand Medicaid expansion’s effect on the treatment patterns and health outcomes of patients with cancer.},

	abstract = {Policy Points: We take advantage of Oregon's Medicaid lottery to gauge the causal effects of Medicaid coverage on mental health care, how effectively it addresses unmet needs, and how those effects differ for those with and without a history of depression. Medicaid coverage reduced the prevalence of undiagnosed depression by almost 50\% and untreated depression by more than 60\%. It increased use of medications and reduced the share of respondents reporting unmet mental health care needs by almost 40\%. There are likely to be substantial mental health consequences of policy decisions about Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations. Context Expanding Medicaid to previously uninsured adults has been shown to increase detection and reduce the prevalence of depression, but the ways that Medicaid affects mental health care, how effectively it addresses unmet needs, and how those effects differ for those with and without a history of depression remain unclear. Methods We take advantage of Oregon's Medicaid lottery to gauge the causal effects of Medicaid coverage using a randomized-controlled design, drawing on both primary and administrative data sources. Findings Medicaid coverage reduced the prevalence of undiagnosed depression by almost 50\% and untreated depression by more than 60\%. It increased use of medications frequently prescribed to treat depression and related mental health conditions and reduced the share of respondents reporting unmet mental health care needs by almost 40\%. The share of respondents screening positive for depression dropped by 9.2 percentage points overall, and by 13.1 for those with preexisting depression diagnoses, with greatest relief in symptoms seen primarily in feeling down or hopeless, feeling tired, and trouble sleeping—consistent with the increase observed not just in medications targeting depression but also in those targeting sleep. Conclusions Medicaid coverage had significant effects on the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of a population with substantial unmet mental health needs. Coverage increased access to care, reduced the prevalence of untreated and undiagnosed depression, and substantially improved the symptoms of depression. There are likely to be substantial mental health consequences of policy decisions about Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES To estimate national changes in self-reported coverage, access to care, and health during the ACA’s first 2 open enrollment periods and to assess differences between low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not expand Medicaid. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis of the 2012-2015 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily national telephone survey. Using multivariable regression to adjust for pre-ACA trends and sociodemographics, we examined changes in outcomes for the nonelderly US adult population aged 18 through 64 years (n = 507 055) since the first open enrollment period began in October 2013. Linear regressions were used to model each outcome as a function of a linear monthly time trend and quarterly indicators. Then, pre-ACA (January 2012-September 2013) and post-ACA (January 2014-March 2015) changes for adults with incomes below 138\% of the poverty level in Medicaid expansion states (n = 48 905 among 28 states and Washington, DC) vs nonexpansion states (n = 37 283 among 22 states) were compared using a differences-in-differences approach. Supplemental content at jama.com CME Quiz at jamanetworkcme.com and CME Questions page 403 EXPOSURES Beginning of the ACA’s first open enrollment period (October 2013). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported rates of being uninsured, lacking a personal physician, lacking easy access to medicine, inability to afford needed care, overall health status, and health-related activity limitations.
RESULTS Among the 507 055 adults in this survey, pre-ACA trends were significantly worsening for all outcomes. Compared with the pre-ACA trends, by the first quarter of 2015, the adjusted proportions who were uninsured decreased by 7.9 percentage points (95\% CI, −9.1 to −6.7); who lacked a personal physician, −3.5 percentage points (95\% CI, −4.8 to −2.2); who lacked easy access to medicine, −2.4 percentage points (95\% CI, −3.3 to −1.5); who were unable to afford care, −5.5 percentage points (95\% CI, −6.7 to −4.2); who reported fair/poor health, −3.4 percentage points (95\% CI, −4.6 to −2.2); and the percentage of days with activities limited by health, −1.7 percentage points (95\% CI, −2.4 to −0.9). Coverage changes were largest among minorities; for example, the decrease in the uninsured rate was larger among Latino adults (−11.9 percentage points [95\% CI, −15.3 to −8.5]) than white adults (−6.1 percentage points [95\% CI, −7.3 to −4.8]). Medicaid expansion was associated with significant reductions among low-income adults in the uninsured rate (differences-indifferences estimate, −5.2 percentage points [95\% CI, −7.9 to −2.6]), lacking a personal physician (−1.8 percentage points [95\% CI, −3.4 to −0.3]), and difficulty accessing medicine (−2.2 percentage points [95\% CI, −3.8 to −0.7]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ACA’s first 2 open enrollment periods were associated with significantly improved trends in self-reported coverage, access to primary care and medications, affordability, and health. Low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid reported significant gains in insurance coverage and access compared with adults in states that did not expand Medicaid.},

A systematic review was undertaken to assess the association between Medicaid expansion and the goals of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the context of cancer care. The purpose of this article is to summarize the currently published literature and to determine the effects of Medicaid expansion on outcomes during points along the cancer care continuum. Methods: A systematic search for relevant studies was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Three independent observers used an abstraction form to code outcomes and perform a quality and risk of bias assessment using predeﬁned criteria. Results: A total of 48 studies were identiﬁed. The most common outcomes assessed were the impact of Medicaid expansion on insurance coverage (23.4\% of studies), followed by evaluation of racial and/or socioeconomic disparities (17.4\%) and access to screening (14.5\%). Medicaid expansion was associated with increases in coverage for cancer patients and survivors as well as reduced racial- and income-related disparities. Conclusions: Medicaid expansion has led to improved access to insurance coverage among cancer patients and survivors, particularly among low-income and minority populations. This review highlights important gaps in the existing oncology literature, including a lack of studies evaluating changes in treatment and access to end-of-life care following implementation of expansion.},

	abstract = {Approximately half of postpartum individuals in the US do not receive any routine postpartum health care. Currently, federal Medicaid coverage for pregnant individuals lapses after the last day of the month in which the 60th postpartum day occurs, which limits longer-term postpartum care.To assess whether health insurance coverage extension or improvements in access to health care are associated with postpartum health care utilization and maternal outcomes within 1 year post partum.Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for US-based studies from inception to November 16, 2022. The reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were scanned for potentially eligible studies. Risk of bias was assessed using questions from the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool. Strength of evidence (SoE) was assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Methods Guide.A total of 25 973 citations were screened and 28 mostly moderate-risk-of-bias nonrandomized studies were included (3 423 781 participants) that addressed insurance type (4 studies), policy changes that made insurance more comprehensive (13 studies), policy changes that made insurance less comprehensive (2 studies), and Medicaid expansion (9 studies). Findings with moderate SoE suggested that more comprehensive association was likely associated with greater attendance at postpartum visits. Findings with low SoE indicated a possible association between more comprehensive insurance and fewer preventable readmissions and emergency department visits.The findings of this systematic review suggest that evidence evaluating insurance coverage and postpartum visit attendance and unplanned care utilization is, at best, of moderate SoE. Future research should evaluate clinical outcomes associated with more comprehensive insurance coverage.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: 
          To synthesize the empirical research evidence about the association between Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and increasing perinatal care access and utilization among low-income women.
          DATA SOURCES: 
          We searched MEDLINE through PubMed (1966–present), EMBASE (Ovid), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (1982–present), PAIS Index (ProQuest), Web of Science (1900–present), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Our review focuses on the association between Medicaid expansion under the ACA and perinatal care access and utilization, which cannot be subjected to randomized controlled trials, therefore ClinicalTrials.gov was not included in our search.
          METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: 
          A comprehensive search of the research literature was performed using Covidence. Studies were eligible if they were based on population data and research designs ensuring that the exposure (ie, Medicaid expansion under the ACA) preceded the perinatal care access or utilization outcome, had an appropriate comparison group, presented quantitative data, and examined pregnant or postpartum women. The search in six bibliographic databases returned 1,243 records, with 855 abstracts reviewed, 34 full-text articles screened for eligibility, and nine eligible studies included in the systematic review.
          TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: 
          Stata 16 software was used to generate summary estimates, forest plots, funnel plots, and heterogeneity statistics. Random effects modeling based on pooled data revealed that Medicaid expansion was associated with a 6.1\% increase in Medicaid enrollment for pregnant women (95\% CI 1.3–10.9\%) and a 3.3\% increase in perinatal care utilization (95\% CI 0.2–6.3\%).
          CONCLUSION: 
          Medicaid expansion under the ACA is associated with a modest and statistically significant increase in perinatal care access and utilization among low-income women.},

	abstract = {Background:

The goal of the Affordable Care Act was to improve health outcomes through expanding insurance, including through Medicaid expansion. We systematically reviewed the available literature on the association of Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion with cardiac outcomes.

Methods:

Consistent with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we performed systematic searches in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature using the keywords such as Medicaid expansion and cardiac, cardiovascular, or heart to identify titles published from 1/2014 to 7/2022 that evaluated the association between Medicaid expansion and cardiac outcomes.

Results:

A total of 30 studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 14 studies (47\%) used a difference-in-difference study design and 10 (33\%) used a multiple time series design. The median number of postexpansion years evaluated was 2 (range, 0.5–6) and the median number of expansion states included was 23 (range, 1–33). Commonly assessed outcomes included insurance coverage of and utilization of cardiac treatments (25.0\%), morbidity/mortality (19.6\%), disparities in care (14.3\%), and preventive care (41.1\%). Medicaid expansion was generally associated with increased insurance coverage, reduction in overall cardiac morbidity/mortality outside of acute care settings, and some increase in screening for and treatment of cardiac comorbidities.

Conclusions:

Current literature demonstrates that Medicaid expansion was generally associated with increased insurance coverage of cardiac treatments, improvement in cardiac outcomes outside of acute care settings, and some improvements in cardiac-focused prevention and screening. Conclusions are limited because quasi-experimental comparisons of expansion and nonexpansion states cannot account for unmeasured state-level confounders.},

	abstract = {Insurance status has been linked to important differences in cancer treatment and outcomes in the US. With more than 15 million individuals gaining health insurance through Medicaid expansion, there is an increasing need to understand the implications of this policy within the US cancer population. This review provides an overview of the fundamental principles and nuances of Medicaid expansion, as well as the implications for cancer care.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act presented states with an option to expand Medicaid coverage by broadening the eligibility criteria (eg, raising the eligible income level). During the past 10 years, Medicaid expansion has been credited with a 30\% reduction in the population of uninsured individuals in the US. Such a significant change in the insurance profile could have important implications for the 1.7 million patients diagnosed with cancer each year, the oncology teams that care for them, and policy makers. However, several factors may complicate efforts to characterize the effect of Medicaid expansion on the US cancer population. Most notably, there is considerable variation among states in terms of whether Medicaid expansion took place, when expansion occurred, eligibility criteria for Medicaid, and coverage types that Medicaid provides. In addition, economic and health policy factors may be intertwined with factors associated with Medicaid expansion. Finally, variability in the manner in which cancer care has been captured and depicted in large databases could affect the interpretation of findings associated with expansion.The expansion of Medicaid was a historic public policy initiative. To fully leverage this policy to improve oncological care and to maximize learning for subsequent policies, it is critical to understand the effect of Medicaid expansion. This review aims to better prepare investigators and their audiences to fully understand the implications of this important health policy initiative.},

	abstract = {Purpose Moral hazard is a concept that is central to risk and insurance management. It refers to change in economic behavior when individuals are protected or insured against certain risks and losses whose costs are borne by another party. It asserts that the presence of an insurance contract increases the probability of a claim and the size of a claim. Through the US Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, this study seeks to examine the validity and relevance of moral hazard in health care reform and determine how welfare losses or inefficiencies could be mitigated. Design/methodology/approach This study is divided into three sections. The first contrasts conventional moral hazard from an emerging or alternative theory. The second analyzes moral hazard in terms of the evolution, organization, management, and marketing of health insurance in the USA. The third explains why and how salient reform measures under the ACA might induce health care consumption and production in ways that could either promote or restrict personal health and safety as well as social welfare maximization. Findings Insurance generally induces health care (over) consumption. However, not every additional consumption, with or without adverse selection, can be considered wasteful or risky, even if it might cost insurers more in the short run. Moral hazard can generate welfare and equity gains. These gains might vary depending on which ACA provisions, insured population, covered illnesses, treatments, and services, as well as health outcomes are taken into account, and because of the relative ambiguities surrounding definitions of “health.” Actuarial risk models can nonetheless benefit from incorporating welfare and equity gains into their basic assumptions and estimations. Originality/value This is the first study which examines the ACA in the context of the new or alternative theory of moral hazard. It suggests that containing inefficient moral hazard, and encouraging its desirable counterpart, are prime challenges in any health care reform initiative, especially as it adapts to the changing demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the insured population and regulatory landscape of health insurance in the USA.},

We analyze access and satisfaction of three groups of children: Medicaid enrolled, S-CHIP enrolled, and children who are income eligible for Medicaid but carry a card similar to the state's S-CHIP children's card. Both enrollees and providers may believe that these children are enrolled in S-CHIP despite the fact that reimbursement is through the state's Medicaid system. Results indicate that the same network of providers treat, or are perceived by families to treat, the three groups differently. They support the notion that some of the differences in satisfaction between S-CHIP and Medicaid enrollees are related to unmeasured characteristics (for example, income) of the families in the different programs, but that programmatic identity contributes substantially to differential care experience. © 2007 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management},

Important issues that have received little scholarly attention thus far are excluding immigrants’ social rights through decisive policy choices and the distributive consequences of such exclusive policies. In this article, we examine how immigration and state policies on immigrants’ access to safety net programs together influence social inequality in the context of health care. We analyze the combined effect of immigration population density and state immigrant Medicaid eligibility rules on the gap of Medicaid coverage rates between native- and foreign-born populations. When tracking inequality in Medicaid coverage and critical policy changes in the post-PRWORA era, we find that exclusive state policies widen the native-foreign Medicaid coverage gap. Moreover, the effect of state policies is conditional on the size of the immigrant population in that state. Our findings suggest immigrants’ formal integration into the welfare system is crucial for understanding social inequality in the U.S. states.},

In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign country. Given Facebook’s scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook’s user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

	abstract = {Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many people remain uninsured. While studies have examined this population, few have explored patients’ experiences seeking insurance. To elucidate these individuals’ perspectives, we surveyed patients (n = 80) at the University of Michigan Student-Run Free Clinic concerning their activity accessing insurance. Over half of respondents had sought insurance in the past 6 months; 57 \% of respondents qualified for Medicaid by self-reported income (≤138 \% FPL) and all but one were eligible for tax credits on the Health Insurance Marketplace. However, only 35 \% of apparently Medicaid-eligible respondents had recently applied. There was no significant difference in the rate of applying for those above the income cutoff (p = 0.901). Perceived expense of plans and belief of ineligibility for Medicaid discouraged respondents from actively seeking insurance. Personalized outreach emphasizing new Medicaid eligibility requirements and tax credits may be needed to facilitate Medicaid enrollment for some uninsured persons under the ACA.},

	abstract = {Medicaid expansion undertaken through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is already producing major changes in insurance coverage and access to care, but its potential impacts on the labor market are also important policy considerations. Economic theory suggests that receipt of Medicaid might benefit workers who would no longer be tied to specific jobs to receive health insurance (known as job lock), giving them more flexibility in their choice of employment, or might encourage low-income workers to reduce their hours or stop working if they no longer need employment-based insurance. Evidence on labor changes after previous Medicaid expansions is mixed. To view the impact of the ACA on current labor market participation, we analyzed labor-market participation among adults with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, comparing Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states and Medicaid-eligible and -ineligible groups, for the pre-ACA period (2005–13) and the first fifteen months of the expansion (January 2014–March 2015). Medicaid expansion did not result in significant changes in employment, job switching, or full- versus part-time status. While we cannot exclude the possibility of small changes in these outcomes, our findings rule out the large change found in one influential pre-ACA study; furthermore, they suggest that the Medicaid expansion has had limited impact on labor-market outcomes thus far.},

Given a hypothetical policy to increase Medicaid enrollment, for every 1 percentage point of direct increase, networks generate a multiplier effect that boosts participation by an additional 0.26 percentage points. Networks have greatest inﬂuence on individuals who are not proﬁcient in English or who arrived in the United States more recently. Our results are robust to alternative speciﬁcations, including using an ex ante indicator of group-level participation.

	abstract = {Background
The Affordable Care Act established policy mechanisms to increase health insurance coverage in the United States. While insurance coverage has increased, 10 to 15\% of the U.S. population remains uninsured.

Objectives
To assess whether health insurance literacy and financial literacy predict being uninsured, covered by Medicaid, or covered by Marketplace insurance, holding demographic characteristics, attitudes toward risk, and political affiliation constant.

Research Design
Analysis of longitudinal data from fall 2013 and spring 2015 including financial and health insurance literacy and key covariates collected in 2013.

Subjects
2,742 U.S. residents ages 18-64, 525 uninsured in fall 2013, participating in the RAND American Life Panel, a nationally representative internet panel.

Measures
Self-reported health insurance status and type as of spring 2015.

Results
Among the uninsured in 2013, higher financial and health insurance literacy were associated with greater probability of being insured in 2015. For a typical uninsured individual in 2013, the probability of being insured in 2015 was 8.3 percentage points higher with high compared to low financial literacy, and 9.2 percentage points higher with high compared to low health insurance literacy. For the general population, those with high financial and health insurance literacy were more likely to obtain insurance via Medicaid or the Marketplaces compared to being uninsured. The magnitude of coefficients for these predictors was similar to that of commonly used demographic covariates.

Conclusions
A lack of understanding about health insurance concepts and financial illiteracy predict who remains uninsured. Outreach and consumer-education programs should consider these characteristics.},

positive effect., Conclusions. There are 3.1 million adults who lack coverage because
they live in the 20 states that refused to expand Medicaid. Although political party

METHODS: Data are from 64,565 youth (ages 0-17 years) participants in the 2011 to 2015 National Health Interview Survey. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine how the period after national implementation of the ACA (years 2011-2013 vs years 2014-2015) was associated with health insurance coverage and utilization of health care services (well-child visits, having visited an emergency department, and having visited a physician, all in the past 12 months), and whether changes over the pre- and post-ACA periods varied according to race and Latino ethnicity.
RESULTS: The post-ACA period was associated with improvements in insurance coverage and well-child visits for all youth. Latino youth had the largest absolute gain in insurance coverage; however, they continued to have the highest proportion of uninsurance post national ACA implementation. With regard to health care equity, non-Latino black youth were less likely to be uninsured and Latino youth had no significant improvements in insurance coverage relative to non-Latino white youth after national ACA implementation. Inequities in health care utilization for non-Latino black and Latino youth relative to non-Latino white youth did not improve.
CONCLUSIONS: Insurance coverage and well-child visits have significantly improved for all youth since passage of the ACA, but inequities persist, especially for Latino youth.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from the 1998 Current Population Survey, using logistic regression to standardize rates of employer-sponsored coverage by country of origin. RESULTS: In 1997, 16.7 million immigrants were not US citizens. Among non-citizens, 43\% of children and 12\% of elders lacked health insurance, compared with 14\% of non-immigrant children and 1\% of non-immigrant elders. Approximately 50\% of non-citizen full-time workers had employer-sponsored coverage, compared with 81\% of non-immigrant full-time workers. Immigrants from Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Haiti, Korea, and Vietnam were the most likely to be uninsured. Among immigrants who worked full-time, sociodemographic and employment characteristics accounted for most of the variation in employer health insurance. For Central American immigrants, legal status may play a role in high un-insurance rates. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrants who are not US citizens are much less likely to receive employer-sponsored health insurance or government coverage; 44\% are uninsured.

The policy prescriptions that the traditional model generates may thus fail to achieve their goals. Behavioral economics, which integrates insights from psychology into economic analysis, identifies important deviations from the traditional assumptions of rationality and can thus improve our understanding of what drives health insurance take-up and improved policy design.

Methods
Rather than a systematic review of the coverage literature, this article is a primer for considering issues in health insurance coverage from a behavioral economics perspective, supplementing the standard model. We present relevant evidence on decision making and insurance take-up and use it to develop a behavioral approach to both the policy problem posed by the lack of health insurance coverage and possible policy solutions to that problem.

Findings
We found that evidence from behavioral economics can shed light on both the sources of low take-up and the efficacy of different policy levers intended to expand coverage. We then applied these insights to policy design questions for public and private insurance coverage and to the implementation of the recently enacted health reform, focusing on the use of behavioral insights to maximize the value of spending on coverage.

Conclusions
We concluded that the success of health insurance coverage reform depends crucially on understanding the behavioral barriers to take-up. The take-up process is likely governed by psychology as much as economics, and public resources can likely be used much more effectively with behaviorally informed policy design.},

	abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that Latino young adults are uninsured at higher rates relative to other ethnoracial groups. Recent implementation of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased access to health insurance for young adults, in part by maintaining health coverage through their parents until age 26. This paper examines patterns of Latino young adults' insurance coverage during early ACA implementation by addressing three questions: 1) To what extent do Latino young adults remain uninsured relative to their peers of other ethnoracial groups? 2) How do young adults' family socioeconomic background, immigrant characteristics, college enrollment, and employment status mediate their coverage? And, 3) do patterns of insurance coverage differ for employer-provided coverage versus other sources of coverage (including parents’ health insurance)? Using a 2011 representative sample of U.S.-born and 1.5-generation immigrant young adults in California, we find that Latinos are more likely than other ethnoracial groups to remain uninsured. While they are as likely as similar peers to obtain employer-provided health insurance, they are less likely to possess insurance through other sources (including their parents). This study contributes to our understanding of the limits of the ACA in reducing disparities in insurance coverage for Latinos by highlighting the importance of family socioeconomic background, immigrant characteristics, college enrollment, and employment in shaping coverage among this age group.},

	abstract = {Compared to people born in the U.S., immigrants generally are employed in low quality and low paying jobs that do not offer health insurance. They are also known to not have a set place where they can get routine treatment. This is troubling because it suggests that immigrants are more likely to be poor and less likely to receive crucial preventative care to sustain long term health. However, some have backgrounds, such as high education, income, job trainings and legal documentation that help them overcome challenges in accessing good employment and healthcare. In this study, I wanted to know if differences in immigrants’ visa types affect their chance of getting health insurance, employment, and treatment from an inpatient or outpatient facility. I also wanted to know if immigrants doing jobs that require different skill levels have different chances of getting health insurance. I found that the type of visa an immigrant has can affect opportunities of getting insurance, employment and getting treated at both inpatient and outpatient centers. Health insurance was an important contributor to whether immigrants with different visas received treatment. Immigrants with the diversity visa were least likely to access these resources, thus, should be prioritized when intervening. Working in either medium or low skill jobs reduced chances of getting health insurance. This knowledge can help lawmakers better understand the immigrant population and their unique needs. Lawmakers can reference these results to decide whether to remove laws that prevent certain groups of immigrants from accessing healthcare and employment.},

Immigrant health and access to health care in the USA varies widely by ethnicity, citizenship, and legal status. In recent decades, several policy and regulatory changes have worsened health-care quality and access for immigrant populations. These changes include restrictions on access to public health insurance programmes, rhetoric discouraging the use of social services, aggressive immigration enforcement activities, intimidation within health-care settings, decreased caps on the number of admitted refugees, and rescission of protections from deportation. A receding of ethical norms has created an environment favourable for moral and public health crises, as evident in the separation of children from their parents at the southern US border. Given the polarising immigration rhetoric at the national level, individual states rather than the country as a whole might be better positioned to address the barriers to improved health and health care for immigrants in the USA.},

Such expansions in Medicaid eligibility, however, could “crowd out” private insurance coverage, including changes in coverage relating to other ACA provisions. To estimate the extent of such crowd out, I use a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence empirical approach, examining changes in health insurance coverage sources among low-income Americans in states that expanded eligibility relative to comparable individuals in states that did not. Using American Community Survey data from 2009 to 2019, I ﬁnd a 43\% crowd out rate, consisting of a 10.7 percentage point relative increase in Medicaid coverage among low income adults and a 4.6 percentage point relative decline in private health insurance among respondents in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility. Among working adults, my estimates imply a larger 56\% rate of crowding out. Event study analyses provide support for a causal interpretation for my ﬁndings. I further show that my estimates are robust to diﬀerent sample restrictions and estimation choices, are not subject to the issues raised by the new diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence literature, and are similar when I use approaches to identifying crowd out common in the existing literature.},

Methods. We used data from the American Community Survey from 2008 to 2014 to examine changes in the percentage of nonelderly adults who were uninsured, covered by Medicaid, or covered by private health insurance. In addition to presenting overall trends by race/ethnicity, we stratified the analysis by income group and state Medicaid expansion status.

Results. In 2013, 40.5\% of Hispanics and 25.8\% of Blacks were uninsured, compared with 14.8\% of Whites. We found a larger gap in private insurance, which was partially offset by higher rates of public coverage among Blacks and Hispanics. After the main ACA provisions went into effect in 2014, coverage disparities declined slightly as the percentage of adults who were uninsured decreased by 7.1 percentage points for Hispanics, 5.1 percentage points for Blacks, and 3 percentage points for Whites. Coverage gains were greater in states that expanded Medicaid programs.

Conclusions. The ACA has reduced racial/ethnic disparities in coverage, although substantial disparities remain. Further increases in coverage will require Medicaid expansion by more states and improved program take-up in states that have already done so.},

Data Sources 2011–2015 American Community Survey for 3,137,989 low-educated adults aged 19–64 years. Study Design Difference-in-differences regressions accounting for national coverage trends and state fixed effects. Principal Findings Expansion effects doubled in 2015 among low-educated adults, with a nearly 8 percentage-point increase in Medicaid take-up and 6 percentage-point decline in uninsured rate. Significant coverage gains were observed across virtually all examined groups by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Take-up and insurance declines were strongest among younger adults and were generally close by gender and race/ethnicity. Despite the increased take-up however, coverage disparities remained sizeable, especially for young adults and Hispanics who had declining but still high uninsured rates in 2015. There was some evidence of private coverage crowd-out in certain subgroups, particularly among young adults aged 19–26 years and women, including in both individually purchased and employer-sponsored coverage. Conclusions The ACA Medicaid expansions have continued to increase coverage in 2015 across the entire population of low-educated adults and have reduced age disparities in coverage.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study assessed the impact of Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion on health insurance rates and receipt of cardiovascular-related preventive screenings (body mass index, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoproteins, and blood pressure) for cancer survivors seen in community health centers (CHCs). METHODS: This study identified cancer survivors aged 19 to 64 years with at least 3 CHC visits in 13 states from the Accelerating Data Value Across a National Community Health Center Network (ADVANCE). Via inverse probability of treatment weighting multilevel multinomial modeling, insurance rates before and after the ACA were estimated by whether a patient lived in a state that expanded Medicaid, and changes between a pre-ACA time period and 2 postACA time periods were assessed. RESULTS: The weighted estimated sample size included 409 cancer survivors in nonexpansion states and 2650 in expansion states. In expansion states, the proportion of uninsured cancer survivors decreased significantly from 20.3\% in 2012-2013 to 4.5\%in 2016-2017, and the proportion of those with Medicaid coverage increased significantly from 38.8\% to 55.6\%. In nonexpansion states, there was a small decrease in uninsurance rates (from 33.6\% in 2012-2013 to 22.5\% in 2016-2017). Cardiovascularrelated preventive screening rates increased over time in both expansion and nonexpansion states: HbA1c rates nearly doubled from the pre-ACA period (2012-2013) to the post-ACA period (2016-2017) in expansion states (from 7.2\% to 12.8\%) and nonexpansion states (from 9.3\% to 16.8\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a substantial decline in uninsured visits among cancer survivors in Medicaid expansion states. Yet, 1 in 5 cancer survivors living in a state that did not expand Medicaid remained uninsured. Several ACA provisions likely worked together to increase cardiovascular-related preventive screening rates for cancer survivors seen in CHCs.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine changes in health care access and utilization for White, Asian, and Latino immigrants associated with the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in California.
STUDY DESIGN: Using the 2011-2013 and 2015-2017 California Health Interview Survey, we examined changes in 2 health care access and 2 utilization measures among 3 immigrant racial/ethnic groups. We estimated the unadjusted and adjusted percentage point changes in the pre-ACA and post-ACA periods. Adjusted estimates were obtained using linear probability models controlling for predisposing, enabling, and need factors.
RESULTS: After the ACA was nationally implemented in 2014, rates of insurance increased for non-Latino (NL) White, NL Asian, and Latino immigrant groups in California. Latino immigrants had the largest increase in insurance coverage (14.3 percentage points), followed by NL Asian immigrants (9.9 percentage points) and NL White immigrants (9.2 percentage points). Despite benefitting from the largest increase in insurance coverage, the proportion of insured Latino immigrants was still lower than that of NL White and NL Asian immigrants. Latino immigrants reported a small but significant decrease in the usual source of care (-2.8 percentage points) and an increase in emergency department utilization (2.9 percentage points) after the ACA. No significant changes were found after the ACA in health care access and utilization among NL White and NL Asian immigrants.
CONCLUSIONS: Insurance coverage increased significantly for these 3 immigrant groups after the ACA. While Latino immigrants had the largest gain in insurance coverage, the proportion of Latino immigrants with insurance remained the lowest among the 3 immigrant racial/ethnic groups.},

We provide the first comprehensive assessment of these provisions’ effects, using the 2012–2015 American Community Survey and a triple-difference estimation strategy that exploits variation by income, geography, and time. Overall, our model explains 60\% of the coverage gains in 2014–2015. We find that coverage was moderately responsive to price subsidies, with larger gains in state-based insurance exchanges than the federal exchange. The individual mandate's exemptions and penalties had little impact on coverage rates. The law increased Medicaid among individuals gaining eligibility under the ACA and among previously-eligible populations (“woodwork effect”) even in non-expansion states, with no resulting reductions in private insurance. Overall, exchange premium subsidies produced 40\% of the coverage gains explained by our ACA policy measures, and Medicaid the other 60\%, of which 1/2 occurred among previously-eligible individuals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The aim of the cost-sharing provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was to reduce financial barriers for preventive services, including screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) among privately and Medicare-insured individuals. Whether the provision has affected CRC and BC screening prevalence is unknown. The current study investigated whether CRC and BC screening prevalence among privately and Medicare-insured adults by socioeconomic status (SES) changed before and after the ACA. METHODS Data obtained from the National Health Interview Survey pertaining to privately and Medicare-insured adults from 2008 (before the ACA) and 2013 (after the ACA) were used. There were 15,786 adults aged 50 to 75 years in the CRC screening analysis and 14,530 women aged ≥40 years in the BC screening analysis. Changes in guideline-recommended screening between 2008 and 2013 by SES were expressed as the prevalence difference (PD) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) adjusted for demographics, insurance, income, education, body mass index, and having a usual provider. RESULTS Overall, CRC screening prevalence increased from 57.3\% to 61.2\% between 2008 and 2013 (P{\textless}.001). Adjusted CRC screening prevalence during the corresponding period increased in low-income (PD, 5.9; 95\% CI, 1.8 to 10.2), least-educated (PD, 7.2; 95\% CI, 0.9 to 13.5), and Medicare-insured (PD, 6.2; 95\% CI, 1.7 to 10.7) individuals, but not in high-income, most-educated, and privately insured respondents. BC screening remained unchanged overall (70.5\% in 2008 vs 70.2\% in 2013) and in the low SES groups. CONCLUSIONS Increases in CRC screening prevalence between 2008 and 2013 were confined to respondents with low SES. These findings may in part reflect the ACA's removal of financial barriers.

	abstract = {Background: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) removed copayments for screening mammography and colonoscopy in Medicare beneficiaries, but its clinical impact is unknown.
Methods: Using a 5\% random sample of Medicare claims from 2009 through 2012 in individuals age 70 years or older who were due for screening, we examined claims for screening mammography and screening or surveillance colonoscopy for two years prior to ACA (2009–2010) and two years post-ACA (2011–2012). Receipt of the procedures at the patient level was compared across years using generalized estimating equations. Statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Compared with 2009, we found an increase in mammography uptake during the ACA coverage period, with multivariable odds ratios (MOR) of 1.22 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20 to 1.25, P {\textless} .001) for 2011 and 1.17 (95\% CI = 1.15 to 1.20, P {\textless} .001) for 2012 and less change in 2010 (OR = 1.03, 95\% CI = 1.01 to 1.05, P = .01). In contrast to mammography, uptake of screening or surveillance colonoscopy decreased in 2012 (MOR = 0.95, 95\% CI = 0.92 to 0.98, P = .002) compared with 2009, with no change in 2010 (MOR = 1.01, 95\% CI = 0.99 to 1.04, P = .47) or 2011 (MOR = 1.01, 95\% CI = 0.99 to 1.04, P = .34). Other factors associated with procedure receipt included younger age and prior preventive health visits. In an analysis restricted to patients age 70 to 74 years, colonoscopy use increased slightly in 2011 but was unchanged in 2012, and the findings by year for mammography were consistent with the main analysis.
Conclusions: Following ACA implementation with concomitant reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures, there was a statistically significant increment in mammography uptake but not colonoscopy. This suggests that affordability is a necessary but not sufficient facilitator of preventive services.},

	abstract = {Coverage disruptions and coverage loss occur frequently among Medicaid enrollees and are associated with delayed health care access and reduced medication adherence. Little is known about the effect on churning of the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which had the potential to reduce coverage disruptions as a result of increased outreach and more generous income eligibility criteria. We used a difference-in-differences framework to compare rates of coverage disruption in expansion versus nonexpansion states, and in subgroups of states that used alternative expansion strategies. We found that among low-income Medicaid beneficiaries ages 19–64, disruption in coverage decreased 4.3 percentage points in the post-ACA period in expansion states compared to nonexpansion states, and there was a similar decrease in the share of people who experienced a period without any insurance. Men, people of color, and those without chronic illnesses experienced the largest improvements in coverage continuity. Coverage disruptions declined in both traditional expansion states and those that used Section 1115 waivers for expansion. Our quasi-experimental study provides the first nationwide evidence that Medicaid expansion led to decreased rates of coverage disruption. We estimate that half a million fewer adults experienced an episode of churning annually.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To determine if Medicaid expansion is associated with increased volumes of lung cancer screenings.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study was performed to compare the annual growth rates in lung cancer screenings between states that expanded Medicaid (n = 31) versus those that did not (n = 17). Using the American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry, we calculated the average annual growth rate between 2016 and 2019 for both groups. Secondary analyses between these two groups also included calculations of the percentages of studies considered appropriate by USPSTF criteria.
Results
No significant difference was identified in the average annual growth in lung cancer screenings between Medicaid expanding and non-expanding states (57.6\%, 50.3\%, P = 0.51). No difference was observed in the percentage of studies considered appropriate (Medicaid expanding = 89.6\%, non-expanding = 90.2\%, P = 0.72). At baseline, there were socioeconomic differences between both groups of states. Medicaid expanding states had a more urban population (76.5\% versus 67.9\%, P = 0.05) and higher average incomes (\$56,947, \$49,876, P {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusion
No association is found between Medicaid expansion and increasing volumes of lung cancer screening exams. Although no data is available in the registry for screening exams before the implementation of Medicaid expansion (2014), most nationwide estimates of lung screening rates report a low baseline ({\textless}5\%). Furthermore, despite being advantaged in other ways, such as with a more urban population or with higher incomes, the Medicaid expansion cohort does not demonstrate a higher growth rate. These findings suggest Medicaid expansion alone will not increase lung cancer screenings.},

	abstract = {In this issue of Pediatrics, Cholera et a1 used a controlled interrupted time series design to examine differences in health care use of Latinx children as it relates to federal immigration policy enacted in 2017. Electronic medical record data from four major health care systems in North Carolina were analyzed before and after restrictive immigration policy was enacted after the 2016 election. Among Latinx children in the outpatient setting, they found a sustained increase in visit cancellation for the uninsured subgroup, a proxy for undocumented immigrant children in North Carolina.1One aim of the study was to explore whether restrictive immigration policy resulted in a “chilling effect” for all Latino children. A chilling effect is defined as a deterring effect on the behavior of an individual or group through fear of legal action.2 Widely used during the 1996 welfare reform, today, like then, it refers to immigrant families’ decision not to participate in the use of public benefits and services out of fear, confusion, or perceived threat. This phenomenon is of particular concern for the public charge rule changes that were enacted in 2019 (but leaked to the public in 2018), which broadened the reasons why immigrants may be denied legal permanent residence or extension of a temporary visa on the basis of their use or possible use of public benefits, including Medicaid. Several organizations estimated the impact to be far reaching in that it includes the 10.5 million children, mostly American citizens, in benefits-receiving immigrant families.3,4 In a study reported by the Urban Institute, researchers found that in 2019, 1 in 5 adults in immigrant families with children avoided public benefits and 31.5\% did so in low-income families.5},

	abstract = {Recent research has shown that concern about the apprehension and deportation of undocumented immigrants can affect how members of their households who are eligible for public benefits choose to participate in public programs. The extent to which this “chilling effect” broadly affects adults’ Medicaid enrollment nationally remains unclear, in part because of the difficulty of isolating undocumented immigrants in survey data. In this study we identified households that likely included undocumented immigrants and then examined whether gains in health care coverage due to the expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were dampened for eligible people living in households with mixed immigration status. We found no significant differences in coverage gains for people in mixed- relative to non-mixed-status households in expansion states. Coverage gains were significantly lower, however, for people in mixed-status households relative to those in non-mixed-status households in nonexpansion states. These findings suggest that household immigration status may have dampened the “woodwork effect,” whereby the ACA enhanced knowledge about program availability, in turn increasing Medicaid enrollment in nonexpansion states among people previously eligible for the program but not enrolled in it.},

	abstract = {Background
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program provides temporary relief from deportation and work permits for previously undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. DACA faced direct threats under the Trump administration. There is select evidence of the short-term impacts of DACA on population health, including on birth outcomes, but limited understanding of the long-term impacts.

Methods
We evaluated the association between DACA program and birth outcomes using California birth certificate data (2009–2018) and a difference-in-differences approach to compare post-DACA birth outcomes for likely DACA-eligible mothers to birth outcomes for demographically similar DACA-ineligible mothers. We also separately compared birth outcomes by DACA eligibility status in the first 3 years after DACA passage (2012–2015) and in the subsequent 3 years (2015–2018) - a period characterized by direct threats to the DACA program - as compared to outcomes in the years prior to DACA passage.

Results
In the 7 years after its passage, DACA was associated with a lower risk of small-for-gestational age (− 0.018, 95\% CI: − 0.035, − 0.002) and greater birthweight (45.8 g, 95\% CI: 11.9, 79.7) for births to Mexican-origin individuals that were billed to Medicaid. Estimates were consistent but of smaller magnitude for other subgroups. Associations between DACA and birth outcomes were attenuated to the null in the period that began with the announcement of the Trump U.S. Presidential campaign (2015-2018), although confidence intervals overlapped with estimates from the immediate post-DACA period.

Conclusions
These findings suggest weak to modest initial benefits of DACA for select birthweight outcomes during the period immediately following DACA passage for Mexican-born individuals whose births were billed to Medicaid; any benefits were subsequently attenuated to the null. The benefits of DACA for population health may not have been sufficient to counteract the impacts of threats to the program's future and heightened immigration enforcement occurring in parallel over time.

	abstract = {Exclusionary immigration policies, as a form of structural racism, have led to a sizeable undocumented population that is largely barred from access to resources in the United States. Existing research suggests that undocumented immigration status detrimentally impacts mobility, yet few studies have tested the impacts of legal status on psychological wellbeing. Most importantly, we know little about how changes to legal status impact wellbeing. Announced in 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program allows eligible undocumented youth to apply for temporary lawful status. Drawing on cross-sectional survey data from 487 Latino immigrant young adults in California collected in 2014 and 2015, we analyze the predictors of three specialized outcomes related to immigrants' psychological wellbeing-distress, negative emotions, and deportation worry before and after a transition from undocumented to lawfully present status. Results show that retrospective reports of past psychological wellness, when all respondents were undocumented, are predicted primarily by socioeconomic status. However, reports of current psychological wellness are predicted by DACA status. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the positive emotional consequences of transitioning out of undocumented status for immigrant young adults.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of changes in immigration policy on health outcomes among undocumented immigrants are not well known. We aimed to examine the physical and mental health effects of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme, a 2012 US immigration policy that provided renewable work permits and freedom from deportation for a large number of undocumented immigrants.
METHODS: We did a retrospective, quasi-experimental study using nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional data from the US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for the period January, 2008, to December, 2015. We included non-citizen, Hispanic adults aged 19-50 years in our analyses. We used a difference-in-differences strategy to compare changes in health outcomes among individuals who met key DACA eligibility criteria (based on age at immigration and at the time of policy implementation) before and after programme implementation versus changes in outcomes for individuals who did not meet these criteria. We additionally restricted the sample to individuals who had lived in the USA for at least 5 years and had completed high school or its equivalent, in order to hold fixed two other DACA eligibility criteria. Our primary outcomes were self-reported overall health (measured on a 5 point Likert scale) and psychological distress (Kessler 6 [K6] scale), the latter was administered to a random subset of NHIS respondents.
FINDINGS: Our final sample contained 14 973 respondents for the self-reported health outcome and 5035 respondents for the K6 outcome. Of these individuals, 3972 in the self-reported health analysis and 1138 in the K6 analysis met the DACA eligibility criteria. Compared with people ineligible for DACA, the introduction of DACA was associated with no significant change among DACA-eligible individuals in terms of self-reported overall health (b=0·056, 95\% CI -0·024 to 0·14, p=0·17) or the likelihood of reporting poor or fair health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·98, 95\% CI 0·66-1·44, p=0·91). However, DACA-eligible individuals experienced a reduction in K6 score compared with DACA-ineligible individuals (adjusted incident risk ratio 0·78, 95\% CI 0·56-0·95, p=0·020) and were less likely to meet screening criteria for moderate or worse psychological distress (aOR 0·62, 95\% CI 0·41-0·93, p=0·022).
INTERPRETATION: Economic opportunities and protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants, as offered by DACA, could confer large mental health benefits to such individuals. Health consequences should be considered by researchers and policy makers in evaluations of the broader welfare effects of immigration policy.

We exploit a difference-in-differences setup that relies on the discontinuities in the program eligibility criteria. We find that DACA increased insurance coverage. In states that granted access to Medicaid, the increase was driven by an increase in public insurance take-up. Where public coverage was not available, DACA eligibility increased individually purchased insurance. Despite the increase in insurance coverage, we find small or non-significant increases in health care use. There is some evidence that DACA increased demand for mental health services. After 2012, DACA-eligible individuals were also more likely to report a usual place of care and less likely to delay care because of financial restrictions. Finally, we find some evidence that DACA improved self-reported health and reduced depression symptoms, indicators of stress and anxiety, and hypertension. These improvements are concentrated among individuals with income below the federal poverty level.},

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program granted temporary protection from deportation to more than 780,000 unauthorized immigrants. We used Medicaid claims data from Oregon and exploited the quasi-random assignment of DACA eligibility among mothers with birthdates close to the DACA age qualification cutoff. Mothers’ DACA eligibility significantly decreased adjustment and anxiety disorder diagnoses among their children. Parents’ unauthorized status is thus a substantial barrier to normal child development and perpetuates health inequalities through the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.},

Foreign-born adults (18-64 years of age) from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey are the study population. Health insurance coverage predictors and the main reasons for being uninsured are compared across cohorts and by documentation status. A logistic-regression two-part multivariate model is used to adjust for confounding factors. The analyses determine that legal status is a strong health insurance predictor, particularly among long-stayed undocumented immigrants. Immigration status is the main reported reason for lacking health insurance. Although long-stayed documented immigrants are likely to benefit from the Affordable Care Act implementation, undocumented immigrants and short-stayed documented immigrants may encounter difficulties getting health insurance coverage.

We used multivariable and decomposition regression analyses to investigate the role of documentation status in access disparities between Mexicans and other Latinos in California. Our findings show that after the implementation of these provisions in California, insurance coverage increased for US- and foreign-born Latinos, including undocumented Latinos. Our decomposition analyses show that after implementation, disparities between Mexicans and other Latinos declined with respect to having coverage and a usual source of care. Without the implementation of these provisions in 2014, these disparities would have been 5.76 percent and 0.31 percent larger, respectively. In contrast, legal documentation status was positively associated with disparities between Mexicans and other Latinos in having coverage and physician visits. If Mexican Latinos had had the same share of undocumented immigrants as other Latinos, disparities in health insurance coverage would have declined by 24.17 percent.},

	abstract = {Safety-net programs improve health for low-income children over the short and long term. In September 2018 the Trump administration announced its intention to change the guidance on how to identify a potential “public charge,” defined as a noncitizen primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. After this change, immigrants’ applications for permanent residence could be denied for using a broader range of safety-net programs. We investigated whether the announced public charge rule affected the share of children enrolled in Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, using county-level data. Results show that a 1-percentage-point increase in a county’s noncitizen share was associated with a 0.1-percentage-point reduction in child Medicaid use. Applied nationwide, this implies a decline in coverage of 260,000 children. The public charge rule was adopted in February 2020, just before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in the US. These results suggest that the Trump administration’s public charge announcement could have led to many thousands of eligible, low-income children failing to receive safety-net support during a severe health and economic crisis.},

Using the 2015 Latino National Health and Immigration Survey, a nationally representative sample of Latinos (n = 1493), we find that variation in health insurance access among Latinos can be traced to immigration status. This study finds no differences among U.S.-born versus foreign-born Latinos in the likelihood of being uninsured in 2015. However, among foreign-born Latinos, unauthorised immigrants are five times more likely than naturalised citizens to be uninsured and less likely to visit a primary care provider or clinic, even after controlling for other factors including language, income and education.},

	abstract = {Since 2014, 32 states implemented Medicaid expansion by removing the categorical criteria for childless adults and by expanding income eligibility to 138\% of the federal poverty level (FPL) for all non-elderly adults. Previous studies found that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion improved rates of being insured, unmet needs for care due to cost, number of physician visits, and health status among low-income adults. However, a few recent studies focused on the expansion’s effect on racial/ethnic disparities and used the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) disparity approach with a limited set of access measures. This quasi-experimental study examined the effect of Medicaid expansion on racial/ethnic disparities in access to health care for U.S. citizens aged 19 to 64 with income below 138\% of the federal poverty line. The difference-in-differences model compared changes over time in 2 measures of insurance coverage and 8 measures of access to health care, using National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2010 to 2016. Analyses used the NAM definition of disparities. Medicaid expansion was associated with significant decreases in uninsured rates and increases in Medicaid coverage among all racial/ethnic groups. There were differences across racial/ethnic groups regarding which specific access measures improved. For delayed care and unmet need for care, decreases in racial/ethnic disparities were observed. After the ACA Medicaid expansion, most access outcomes improved for disadvantaged groups, but also for others, with the result that disparities were not significantly reduced.},

	abstract = {Objective: Mortality rates for cervical cancer have increased among foreign-born women in the United States in the last two decades. Previous research indicates that rates of Pap testing are lower among foreign-born women than in U.S.-born women. This study identifies screening rates among foreign-born women by birthplace and duration in the United States.

Methods: We used data from 4 years (1998, 1999, 2000, 2003) of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to estimate Pap testing rates by birthplace (Mexico, Central America, Caribbean, South America, Europe, Russia, Africa, Middle East, India, Asia, and Southeast Asia) and percent of lifetime spent in the United States for women aged ≥18 years (n = 70,775). Rates were age standardized to the 2000 U.S. population.

Results: After adjusting for demographic characteristics and health indicators, we found that 18.6\% (95\% CI 16.7, 20.6) of recent immigrants ({\textless} 25\% of lifetime in the United States) and 9.9\% (95\% CI 9.0, 10.8) of established immigrants (≥25\% of lifetime in the United States)never received a Pap test in their lifetime compared with 5.8\% (95\% CI 5.5, 6.1) of U.S.-born women. Adjusted prevalence of never receiving a Pap test was highest among women from Asia, Southeast Asia, and India (19.6\%), South America (12.7\%), Mexico (11.2\%), Caribbean (11.0\%), Europe (9.9\%), and Central America (9.2\%).

Conclusions: Significant differences exist in rates of screening for cervical cancer between foreign-born groups by birthplace and by duration in the United States. Nationally and locally funded screening programs may benefit from these findings in developing screening strategies for foreign-born women.},

Methods: We conducted a qualitative study utilizing semi-structured focus groups and identified common themes via grounded theory analysis.

Results: There were 53 female refugee participants from Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Over half of all women surveyed expressed a fear of pelvic exams and loss of modesty as barriers to seeking gynecologic care, with nearly 34\% avoiding routine pap tests. Of the 18 participants who were asked if they were aware of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination, only one had heard of the vaccine and none had received it for themselves or their children. Over 60\% of participants were interested in educational materials surrounding HPV and pap tests.

Conclusion: There is a significant lack of knowledge regarding cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination among refugee women in San Diego, California. Refugee women in this study were interested in multi-modal educational materials as part of a cervical cancer screening toolkit.},

	abstract = {Objective 
        The aim of the study was to provide national estimates of Pap test receipt, by birthplace, and percent of lifetime in the United States (US).
        Materials and Methods 
        Pooled nationally representative data (2005, 2008, 2013, 2015) from the National Health Interview Survey were used to examine differences in Pap test receipt among adult US women by birthplace and percent of lifetime in the US. Descriptive estimates were age-adjusted. Regression models were adjusted for selected sociodemographic and healthcare access and utilization factors and presented as predicted margins.
        Results 
        Foreign-born women 18 years and older were more than twice as likely to have never received a Pap test compared with US-born women (18.6\% vs 6.8\%). Regression models showed that foreign-born women from Mexico (9.8\%), South America (12.6\%), Caribbean (14.6\%), Southeast Asia (13.7\%), Central Asia (20.4\%), South Asia (22.9\%), Middle East (25.0\%), Africa (27.8\%), Europe (16.4\%), and Former Soviet Union (28.2\%) were more likely to be unscreened compared with US-born women (7.6\%). Foreign-born women who spent less than 25\% of their life in the US had higher prevalence of never having a Pap test (20\%) compared with foreign-born who spent more than 25\% of their life in the US (12.7\%).
        Conclusions 
        Using national survey, we found that where a woman is born and the percent of her lifetime spent residing in the US do impact whether she gets screened at least once in her lifetime.
        Impact 
        These findings may inform cervical cancer screening efforts targeting foreign-born women.},

They apply four measures of relative disparity and three measures of absolute disparity to trends in US lung cancer incidence by area-socioeconomic position and race-ethnicity from 1992 to 2004. Among females, measures of absolute and relative disparity suggested that area-socioeconomic and race-ethnic disparities increased over these 12 years but differed widely with respect to the magnitude of the change. Among males, the authors found substantial disagreement among summary measures of relative disparity with respect to the magnitude and the direction of change in disparities. Among area-socioeconomic groups, the index of disparity increased by 47\% and the relative concentration index decreased by 116\%, while for race-ethnicity the index of disparity increased by 36\% and the Theil index increased by 13\%. The choice of a summary measure of disparity may affect the interpretation of changes in health disparities. Important issues to consider are the reference point from which differences are measured, whether to measure disparity on the absolute or relative scale, and whether to weight disparity measures by population size. A suite of indicators is needed to provide a clear picture of health disparity change.},

This study aims to determine associations between 1) face-to-face and 2) e-mail PPC and adults’ likelihood of receiving breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screenings. Cross-sectional, secondary data analysis was conducted using nationally-representative 2011-2015 MEPS, 2011-2015 NHIS, and HINTS 4 Cycles 1-4 survey data. Adults reported how often physicians spent enough time with them; explained so they understood; listened to them; showed respect; gave them a chance to ask questions; addressed feelings and emotions; involved them in decisions; confirmed understanding; and helped them with uncertainty. Adults reported whether or not they used e-mail to communicate with their health care provider (e-mail PPC). Crude and adjusted logistic regression were used to evaluate the odds of receiving cancer screenings based on qualities of face-to-face and e-mail PPC. In adjusted models using HINTS data, adults reporting involvement in their decision making was associated with higher odds of receiving breast (OR=1.38; 95\% CI=1.11, 1.71), cervical (OR=1.30; 95\% CI=1.06, 1.60) and colorectal (OR=1.25; 95\% CI=1.03, 1.51) cancer screenings. Similar results were found when evaluating associations between adults’ chances to ask questions and all cancer screenings (breast OR=1.28; 95\% CI=1.04, 1.58; cervical OR=1.27; 95\% CI=1.04, 1.55; colorectal OR=1.29; 95\% CI=1.05, 1.57). Using MEPS data, giving specific instructions (breast OR= 1.19; 95\% CI=1.06, 1.33; colorectal OR=1.23; 95\% CI=1.10, 1.37) and the instructions were easy to understand (breast OR=1.13; 95\% CI=1.03, 1.23; colorectal OR=1.10; 95\% CI=1.01, 1.21) were most influential at increasing the odds of breast and colorectal cancer screenings. Using NHIS data, e-mail PPC increased the odds of receiving breast (OR=1.38; 95\% CI=1.26, 1.50), cervical (OR=1.10; 1.02, 1.20) and colorectal (OR=1.55; 95\% CI=1.42, 1.69) cancer screenings compared to adults who did not use e-mail PPC. No significant associations were observed using HINTS data. Several qualities of face-to-face PPC were influential on adults’ likelihood of receiving breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screenings. Results from this study can be used to develop training to 1) empower patients to be more engaged in preventive health care practices and 2) educate health care providers on ways to apply these qualities when discussing screening recommendations with their patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the use of e-mail PPC and cancer screening. As more clinics encourage e-mail PPC, more research is needed to determine how best it can be incorporated into traditional health care visits.},

Contextual variables capture the characteristics of the population that disproportionately relies on the health care safety net, the public policy support for low-income and safety-net populations, and the structure of the health care market and safety-net services within that market. Until recently, the literature in this area has been largely qualitative and descriptive and few multivariate studies comprehensively investigated the contextual determinants of access. The comprehensive and systematic approach suggested by the framework will enable researchers to strengthen the external validity of results by accounting for the influence of a consistent set of contextual factors across locations and populations.

	abstract = {Introduction
This study aims to evaluate the trends in the impact of Medicaid expansion on the use of selected recommended clinical preventive services and examine the differences in use by income level over time.
Methods
The data were obtained from the 2011–2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and were analyzed in 2021. This study conducted a difference-in-differences analysis of the association between Medicaid expansion and the use of 5 clinical preventive services, including colon/breast/cervical cancer screenings, HIV testing, and influenza vaccination. Annual percentage change was applied to assess the trends in the impact of Medicaid expansion on the use of clinical preventive services.
Results
The use of all the 5 clinical preventive services varied over time. In almost every year, the use of 4 clinical preventive services (all but HIV testing) among Medicaid expansion states was higher than that among the nonexpansion states. People with lower income used 4 clinical preventive services (all but HIV testing) less frequently than those with higher income, regardless of their residence in expansion or nonexpansion groups. Among the lower-income group, the use of 5 clinical preventive services increased after Medicaid expansion almost every year, with the use of colon cancer screening and HIV testing reaching statistical significance and the impact of Medicaid expansion in the use of each clinical preventive service kept stable from 2014 to 2019.
Conclusions
These findings provide evidence that Medicaid expansion may be associated with sustainably increased use of the selected recommended clinical preventive services among the lower-income population and that Medicaid expansion to reduce financial barriers may be an effective strategy to improve population health.},

However, while second-generation Mexicans assimilate socio-economically, their health deteriorates. This phenomenon is commonly known as the “Hispanic health paradox”. There is an open debate about whether this unhealthy assimilation is explained by selection on health or by the adoption of less healthy lifestyles. This paper uses a unique dataset linking the birth records of two generations of children born in California and Florida (1970–2009), to analyze the mechanisms behind the generational decline observed in birth outcomes. I show that a modest positive selection on health at the time of migration can account for the the initial advantage in birth outcomes of second-generation Mexicans. At the same time, a simple process of regression towards the mean reverses the apparent paradox, predicting a worse deterioration than the one observed in the data. Using a subset of siblings, and holding constant grandmother-ﬁxed eﬀects, I show that the persistence of healthier behaviors (e.g. smoking during pregnancy) among second-generation Mexican mothers can explain more than half of the diﬀerence between the model prediction and the observed birth outcomes of third-generation Mexicans.},

With data from the 2002/2003 Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health, we gathered evidence using three approaches: 1) we compared health care access among insured and uninsured immigrants and non-immigrants within the U.S.; 2) we contrasted these results with health care access disparities between immigrants and non-immigrants in Canada, a country with universal health care; and 3) we conducted a novel direct comparison of health care access among insured and uninsured U.S. immigrants with Canadian immigrants (all of whom are insured). Outcomes investigated were self-reported unmet medical needs and lack of a regular doctor. Logistic regression models controlled for age, sex, nonwhite status, marital status, education, employment, and self-rated health. In the U.S., odds of unmet medical needs of insured immigrants were similar to those of insured non-immigrants but far greater for uninsured immigrants. The effect of health insurance was even more striking for lack of regular doctor. Within Canada, disparities between immigrants and non-immigrants were similar in magnitude to disparities seen among insured Americans. For both outcomes, direct comparisons of U.S. and Canada revealed significant differences between uninsured American immigrants and Canadian immigrants, but not between insured Americans and Canadians, stratified by nativity. Findings suggest health care insurance is a critical cause of differences between immigrants and non-immigrants in access to primary care, lending robust support for the expansion of health insurance coverage in the U.S. This study also highlights the usefulness of cross-national comparisons for establishing alternative counterfactuals in studies of disparities in health and health care.},

	abstract = {Drawing on forty‐one interviews with both documented and undocumented Latino restaurant workers in San Jose, California, and Houston, Texas, this article examines how documentation status shapes the legal consciousness of immigrant workers. I identify three common narratives that undocumented workers provide to justify not making claims on workplace protection. First, I highlight that an ever‐present fear of deportation inhibits any formal confrontation. Second, I demonstrate how undocumented status leaves undocumented immigrants with a particularly pragmatic and short‐term understanding of their working life in the United States, rendering their working conditions temporary and endurable to them. Third, I expand Gordon and Lenhardt's (2008) discussion of the centrality of work to the American conception of citizenship. I reiterate that this particular sense of belonging is situated vis‐à‐vis other low‐wage workers. These findings provide sociolegal scholars important theoretical contributions for crafting a research agenda on the role of undocumented status and legal mobilization.},

	abstract = {Background
An early provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated cost-sharing for a range of recommended preventive services. This provision took effect in September 2010, but little is known about its effect on preventive service use.
Methods
We evaluated changes in the use of recommended preventive services from 2009 (before the implementation of ACA cost-sharing provision) to 2011/2012 (after the implementation) in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative household interview survey in the US. Specifically, we examined: blood pressure check, cholesterol check, flu vaccination, and cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening, controlling for demographic characteristics and stratifying by insurance type.
Results
There were 64,280 (21,310 before and 42,970 after the implementation of ACA cost-sharing provision) adults included in the analyses. Receipt of recent blood pressure check, cholesterol check and flu vaccination increased significantly from 2009 to 2011/2012, primarily in the privately insured population aged 18–64years, with adjusted prevalence ratios (95\% confidence intervals) 1.03 (1.01–1.05) for blood pressure check, 1.13 (1.09–1.18) for cholesterol check and 1.04 (1.00–1.08) for flu vaccination (all p-values{\textless}0.05). However, few changes were observed for cancer screening. We observed little change in the uninsured population.
Conclusions
These early observations suggest positive benefits from the ACA policy of eliminating cost-sharing for some preventive services. Future research is warranted to monitor and evaluate longer term effects of the ACA on access to care and health outcomes.},

the preventive screening that they are studding consists of blood pressure,  cholesterol check and flu shot. Which I believe are not a good representation fo all screening services. As you can have access to low cost at home tests, traditionally if a  co-pay exists for this test are low, comparing to more complicated screening like colonscopy thus removing the cost sharing for these screening should n't affect the  utilization.

However, future research is needed that uses more rigorous research designs and measures, links immigrant selectivity and outcomes across domains, identifies the mechanisms through which immigrant selectivity matters, and considers different types of immigrant selectivity.

	abstract = {Concepts like race, migration background, or ethnic group are more and more being investigated in health research. It should be noted that those concepts themselves are very heterogeneous. They are, for example, endowed with different rights (e.g., cosmopolitan migrants from the global north, refugees from the global south) (Ambrosini \& van der Leun, 2015) or have to deal with racism or discrimination (Nazroo, 2003). A challenge and a recurrent difficulty in research on the health of migrants is the operationalization of studies due to the heterogeneity of the group. On the one hand, it is unclear which criteria—nationality, mother tongue, ethnicity of grandparents, race, place of birth, place of migration as well as migration regime—are used to determine “migrants,” which makes comparability of the studies difficult (Sheldon \& Parker, 1992). On the other hand, the group of people with a history of migration is very heterogeneous with regard to other lines of difference, such as social milieu/class and gender, but also country of origin and reason and time of migration. This makes the health situation of the so-called migrants very different, and it cannot be described in a generalized way. Research shows that social integration and social support can play a big role in the health status of migrants. It can provide information to the healthcare system, provide emotional support, or simply make someone feel like they are not alone. Social networks also play a big role for people with a so-called migration background or with a so-called different ethnic background (Johnson et al., 2017). In this chapter, we explore the link between health, migration, and networks. In doing so, we will try to minimize the uncertainty of the heterogeneity of the group as much as possible.},

Personal barriers included lack of knowledge and insurance coverage, high cost of care, and immigration status. System barriers included poor access to services, lack of interpreter services, and insensitivity to patient needs. Facilitators to screening included knowledge of disease, access to information sources, physician recommendation, and social networks. Cultural norms and resource availability at the individual and system levels influence screening among immigrants.

Programs with a population-based approach can reach a large majority of the eligible population and can offer cost-effective interventions with the potential benefit of maximizing early cancer detection and prevention using a complete follow-up plan. The purpose of this review was to summarize the key features of population-based programs to increase CRC screening in the United States. A search was conducted in the SCOPUS, OvidSP, and PubMed databases. The authors selected published reports of population-based programs that met at least 5 of the 6 International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) criteria for cancer prevention and were known to the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. Interventions at the level of individual practices were not included in this review. IARC cancer prevention criteria served as a framework to assess the effective processes and elements of a population-based program. Eight programs were included in this review. Half of the programs met all IARC criteria, and all programs led to improvements in screening rates. The rate of colonoscopy after a positive stool test was heterogeneous among programs. Different population-based strategies were used to promote these screening programs, including system-based, provider-based, patient-based, and media-based strategies. Treatment of identified cancer cases was not included explicitly in 4 programs but was offered through routine medical care. Evidence-based methods for promoting CRC screening at a population level can guide the development of future approaches in health care prevention. The key elements of a successful population-based approach include adherence to the 6 IARC criteria and 4 additional elements (an identified external funding source, a structured policy for positive fecal occult blood test results and confirmed cancer cases, outreach activities for recruitment and patient education, and an established rescreening process).

The objective of this study was to explore pathways associated with the use of health services and to characterize multifaceted associations with the uptake of CRC screening among HAs and AAs. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2012-2013). Participants included HA (n 5 3731) and AA (n 5 1345) respondents ages 50 to 75 years who met CRC screening recommendations. A modified Andersen behavioral model was used to examine pathways that lead to CRC screening uptake, including predisposing characteristics (education, economic, and cultural factors), health insurance, health needs (perceived health status and several comorbidities), and health provider contextual factors (access to care, perceived quality of health services, and distrust in health care). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the models for HAs and AAs. RESULTS: In the HA model, cultural factors (standardized regression coefficient [b] 520.04; P 5 .013) and distrust in health care (b520.05; P 5 .007) directly and negatively affected CRC screening. Similarly, cultural factors (b520.11; P 5 .002) negatively affected CRC screening in the AA model, but distrust in health care was not significant (P 5 .103). In both models, perceived quality of health services was positively associated with CRC screening uptake and mediated the negative association between cultural factors and CRC screening. Access to care was not associated with CRC screening. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between CRC screening and associated factors differ among HAs and AAs, suggesting a need for multilevel interventions tailored to race/ethnicity. The current findings suggest that facilitating access to care without improving perceived quality of health services may be ineffective for increasing the uptake of CRC screening among HAs and AAs.},

And a lower perceived quality of health services lower was associated with reduced CRC screening uptake, but they could not prove the same mediatory effect exists for the access to care as hypothesized.

	abstract = {Because an intervention’s clinical benefit depends on who receives it, a key to improving the efficiency of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is to incentivize its use among the current or former smokers who are most likely to benefit from it. Despite its clinical advantages and cost-effectiveness, only 3.9 percent of the eligible population underwent LDCT screening in 2015. Using individual lung cancer mortality risk, we developed a policy simulation model to explore the potential impact of implementing risk-targeted incentive programs, compared to either implementing untargeted incentive programs or doing nothing. We found that compared to the status quo, an untargeted incentive program that increased overall LDCT screening from 3,900 (baseline) to 10,000 per 100,000 eligible people would save 12,300 life-years and accrue a net monetary benefit (NMB) of \$771 million over a lifetime horizon. Increasing screening by the same amount but targeting higher-risk people would yield an additional 2,470–6,600 life-years and an additional \$210–\$560 million NMB, depending on the extent of the risk-targeting. Risk-targeted incentive programs could include provider-level bonuses, health plan premium subsidies, and smoking cessation programs to maximize their impact. As clinical medicine becomes more personalized, targeting and incentivizing higher-risk people will help enhance population health and economic efficiency.},

	abstract = {Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Lung cancer screening (LCS) reduces NSCLC mortality; however, a lack of diversity in LCS studies may limit the generalizability of the results to marginalized groups who face higher risk for and worse outcomes from NSCLC. Identifying sources of inequity in the LCS pipeline is essential to reduce disparities in NSCLC outcomes. The authors searched 3 major databases for studies published from January 1, 2010 to February 27, 2020 that met the following criteria: 1) included screenees between ages 45 and 80 years who were current or former smokers, 2) written in English, 3) conducted in the United States, and 4) discussed socioeconomic and race-based LCS outcomes. Eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias. Of 3721 studies screened, 21 were eligible. Eligible studies were evaluated, and their findings were categorized into 3 themes related to LCS disparities faced by Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals: 1) eligibility; 2) utilization, perception, and utility; and 3) postscreening behavior and care. Disparities in LCS exist along racial and socioeconomic lines. There are several steps along the LCS pipeline in which Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals miss the potential benefits of LCS, resulting in increased mortality. This study identified potential sources of inequity that require further investigation. The authors recommend the implementation of prospective trials that evaluate eligibility criteria for underserved groups and the creation of interventions focused on improving utilization and follow-up care to decrease LCS disparities.},

	abstract = {What makes some Americans assume that social welfare programs will benefit immigrants rather than native-born Americans? How do these assumptions shape their attitudes about policy? Recent observational research has shown that immigration attitudes and social welfare attitudes are strongly correlated, but we lack evidence of exactly how this relationship works. In this pre-registered survey experiment, I study respondents’ assumptions about beneficiaries of a generic social welfare policy, and test the effects of different “threat” primes on the assumption that the policy benefits immigrants rather than native-born Americans. I find that a prime constructing immigrants as a fiscal threat increases the likelihood that a respondent will make this assumption, while a prime emphasizing cultural or demographic threat has no significant effect. These effects vary by geographic context, but not by relevant attitudes. Attitudes about immigration become an important predictor of policy approval when this assumption is triggered.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer screening (CRC) is recommended by all major US medical organizations but remains underused.To identify interventions associated with increasing CRC screening rates and their effect sizes.PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1, 1996, to August 31, 2017. Key search terms included colorectal cancer and screening.Randomized clinical trials of US-based interventions in clinical settings designed to improve CRC screening test completion in average-risk adults.At least 2 investigators independently extracted data and appraised each study’s risk of bias. Where sufficient data were available, random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain either a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for screening completion for each type of intervention.The main outcome was completion of CRC screening. Examination included interventions to increase completion of (1) initial CRC screening by any recommended modality, (2) colonoscopy after an abnormal initial screening test result, and (3) continued rounds of annual fecal blood tests (FBTs).The main review included 73 randomized clinical trials comprising 366 766 patients at low or medium risk of bias. Interventions that were associated with increased CRC screening completion rates compared with usual care included FBT outreach (RR, 2.26; 95\% CI, 1.81-2.81; RD, 22\%; 95\% CI, 17\%-27\%), patient navigation (RR, 2.01; 95\% CI, 1.64-2.46; RD, 18\%; 95\% CI, 13\%-23\%), patient education (RR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.36; RD, 4\%; 95\% CI, 1\%-6\%), patient reminders (RR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.41; RD, 3\%; 95\% CI, 0\%-5\%), clinician interventions of academic detailing (RD, 10\%; 95\% CI, 3\%-17\%), and clinician reminders (RD, 13\%; 95\% CI, 8\%-19\%). Combinations of interventions (clinician interventions or navigation added to FBT outreach) were associated with greater increases than single components (RR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.29; RD, 7\%; 95\% CI, 3\%-11\%). Repeated mailed FBTs with navigation were associated with increased annual FBT completion (RR, 2.09; 95\% CI, 1.91-2.29; RD, 39\%; 95\% CI, 29\%-49\%). Patient navigation was not associated with colonoscopy completion after an initial abnormal screening test result (RR, 1.21; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.60; RD, 14\%; 95\% CI, 0\%-29\%).Fecal blood test outreach and patient navigation, particularly in the context of multicomponent interventions, were associated with increased CRC screening rates in US trials. Fecal blood test outreach should be incorporated into population-based screening programs. More research is needed on interventions to increase adherence to continued FBTs, follow-up of abnormal initial screening test results, and cost-effectiveness and other implementation barriers for more intensive interventions, such as navigation.},

METHODS: Data from the 2000 and 2003 National Health Interview Surveys are used in this analysis. Cross-tabulations, age, and racial/ethnic group stratified regression analyses are used to examine associations between health insurance status and receipt of mammography, Pap testing, prostate specific antigen tests, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and colorectal endoscopy.
RESULTS: In overall models, uninsurance was associated with lower receipt of all tests except FOBT among participants ages 65-85 years. Underinsurance was associated with lower receipt of mammography among women under 65 years only.
CONCLUSION: These findings show age variation in the association between cancer screening and health insurance coverage. In addition, health insurance appears to act similarly across racial/ethnic groups. Further examination of underinsurance in cancer screening utilization and other health behaviors is needed.},

	abstract = {Background
Comorbidity is associated with poor outcomes for cancer patients but it is less clear how it influences cancer prevention and early detection. This review synthesizes evidence from studies that have quantified the association between comorbidity and participation in breast and cervical screening.
Methods
PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were systematically searched using key terms related to cancer screening and comorbidity for original research articles published between 1 January 1991 and 21 March 2016. Two reviewers independently screened 1283 studies that met eligibility criteria related to Population (adult, non-cancer populations), Exposure (comorbidity), Comparison (a ‘no comorbidity’ group), and Outcome (participation in breast cancer or cervical screening). Data was extracted and risk of bias assessed using a standardised tool from the 22 studies identified for inclusion (17 breast; 13 cervical). Meta-analyses were performed for participation in breast and cervical screening, stratified by important study characteristics.
Results
The majority of studies were conducted in the United States. Results of individual studies were variable. Most had medium to high risk of bias. Based on the three “low risk of bias” studies, mammography screening was less common among those with comorbidity (pooled Odds Ratio 0.66, 95\%CI 0.44–0.88). The one “low risk of bias” study of cervical screening reported a negative association between comorbidity and participation.
Conclusion
While a definitive conclusion could not be drawn, the results from high quality studies suggest that women with comorbidity are less likely to participate in breast, and possibly cervical, cancer screening.},

Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose CT reduces mortality among high-risk current and former smokers and has been covered by public and private insurers without cost sharing since 2015. Patients and referring providers confront numerous barriers to participation in screening. To best serve in multidisciplinary efforts to expand LCS nationwide, radiologists must be knowledgeable of these challenges. A better understanding of the difficulties confronted by other stakeholders will help radiologists continue to collaboratively guide the growth of LCS programs in their communities. This article reviews barriers to participation in LCS for patients and referring providers, as well as possible solutions and interventions currently underway.

A systematic review was carried out between 2000 and 2013 by querying an electronic database using specific keywords. Studies published in English reporting an estimation of the association between level of education and adherence to breast and/or cervical cancer screening were included in the study. Two different meta-analyses were carried out for adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening, respectively: women with the highest level of education and women with the lowest level of education were compared. The level of heterogeneity was investigated and subgroup analyses were carried out. Results. Of 1231 identified articles, 10 cross-sectional studies were included in the analysis. The meta-analyses showed that women with the highest level of education were more likely to have both screenings with an overall OR=1.61 (95\% CI 1.36–1.91; I2=71\%) for mammography and OR=1.96 (95\% CI 1.79–2.16; I2=0\%) for Pap test, respectively. Stratified meta-analysis for breast cancer screening included only studies that reported guidelines with target age of population ≥50years and showed a reduction in the level of heterogeneity and an increase of 36\% in the adherence (95\% CI 1.19–1.55; I2=0\%).

Herein, we present estimates of cancer risk factors and screening tests in 2018 and 2019 among US adults, with a focus on smoking cessation. Cigarette smoking reached a historic low in 2019 (14.2\%) partly because 61.7\% (54.9 million) of all persons who had ever smoked had quit. Yet, the quit ratio was \&lt;45\% among lower-income, uninsured, and Medicaid-insured persons, and was \&lt;55\% among Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, lower-educated, lesbian, gay or bisexual, and recent immigrant persons, and in 12 of 17 Southern states. Obesity levels remain high (2017–2018: 42.4\%) and were disproportionately higher among Black (56.9\%) and Hispanic (43.7\%) women. HPV vaccination in adolescents 13 to 17 years remains underutilized and over 40\% were not up-to-date in 2019. Cancer screening prevalence was suboptimal in 2018 (colorectal cancer ≥50 years: 65.6\%; breast ≥45 years: 63.2\%; cervical 21–65 years: 83.7\%), especially among uninsured adults (colorectal: 29.8\%; breast: 31.1\%). This snapshot of cancer prevention and early detection measures was mixed, and substantial racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities persisted. However, gains could be accelerated with targeted interventions to increase smoking cessation in under-resourced populations, stem the obesity epidemic, and improve screening and HPV vaccination coverage.},

	abstract = {Objective: A significant segment of women remains underscreened with mammography. We sought to summarize literature related to factors associated with receipt of mammography. For data sources, we used English language papers published between 1988 and 2007, including 221 studies describing 4,957,347 women.
Methods: We calculated odds ratios (ORs) associated with receipt of mammography. Random effects modeling was used to assess trends in mammography utilization and to calculate summary multivariate point estimates. Results were stratified by age, race/ethnicity, and study year. We summarized results between 1988 and 2004 and compared recent years with these results.
Results: Physician access barriers, such as not having a physician-recommend mammography (adjusted OR 0.16, 95\% CI 0.08-0.33) and having no primary care provider (OR 0.41, 95\% CI 0.32-0.53), were highly predictive of not obtaining mammography. Past screening behavior correlated strongly with receipt of mammography (clinical breast examination, adjusted OR 9.15, 95\% CI 3.49-23.98) and Pap test (adjusted OR 3.45, 95\% CI 2.12-5.62). With the exception of having no insurance (adjusted OR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.39-0.57), several potential socioeconomic barriers did not appear to have an important impact on screening. Racial and ethnic differences were seen. Concerns about cost, mammography safety, and pain were more important to African American and Latina women, and having no insurance was more important to white and Chinese women. Cost concerns and the presence of a family history of breast cancer were less important to older women, whereas screening knowledge had a stronger impact on mammography use in women aged Ն65 years. When we compared study results before 2004 with those later, we found very little difference in the multivariate, adjusted ORs over time.
Conclusions: Women with poor access to physicians are much less likely to undergo mammography. Improving the frequency and scope of mammography recommendation by primary care providers is the single most important direct contribution the medical community can make toward increasing mammography use.},

Without attempting to be exhaustive, this paper examines some of these approaches. Traditional structural modeling is ﬁrst discussed. A distinction is then drawn between model-based and design-based approaches. Some more recent developments are examined next, namely history-friendly simulation and information-theory based approaches. Finally, in a constructive perspective, structural causal modeling (SCM) is presented, based on the concepts of mechanism and sub-mechanisms, and of recursive decomposition of the joint distribution of variables. This modeling strategy endeavors at representing the structure of the underlying data generating process. It operationalizes the concept of causation through the ordering and role-function of the variables in each of the intelligible sub-mechanisms.},

It is well known that the features of these designs facilitate the identification of a causal estimand and, thus, warrant a causal interpretation of the estimated effect. In this article, we discuss and compare the identifying assumptions of quasi-experiments using causal graphs. The increasing complexity of the causal graphs as one switches from an RCT to RD, IV, or PS designs reveals that the assumptions become stronger as the researcher’s control over treatment selection diminishes. We introduce limiting graphs for the RD design and conditional graphs for the latent subgroups of com-pliers, always takers, and never takers of the IV design, and argue that the PS is a collider that offsets confounding bias via collider bias.},

	abstract = {Delirium occurs in about 80\% cases in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is associated with a longer hospital stay, increased mortality and other related issues. Delirium does not have any biomarker-based diagnosis and is commonly treated with antipsychotic drugs (APD). However, multiple studies have shown controversy over the efficacy or safety of APD in treating delirium. Since randomized controlled trials (RCT) are costly and time-expensive, we aim to approach the research question of the efficacy of APD in the treatment of delirium using retrospective cohort analysis. We plan to use the Causal inference framework to look for the underlying causal structure model, leveraging the availability of large observational data on ICU patients. To explore safety outcomes associated with APD, we aim to build a causal model for delirium in the ICU using large observational data sets connecting various covariates correlated with delirium. We utilized the MIMIC III database, an extensive electronic health records (EHR) dataset with 53,423 distinct hospital admissions. Our null hypothesis is: there is no significant difference in outcomes for delirium patients under different drug-group in the ICU. Through our exploratory, machine learning based and causal analysis, we had findings such as: mean length-of-stay and max length-of-stay is higher for patients in Haloperidol drug group, and haloperidol group has a higher rate of death in a year compared to other two-groups. Our generated causal model explicitly shows the functional relationships between different covariates. For future work, we plan to do time-varying analysis on the dataset.},

We conducted a nested cohort study within a larger randomized trial in a primary care clinic of a large municipal hospital.

The main outcome measures were physician referral for screening colonoscopy and patients’ adherence to referral. One hundred and forty-six (146) patients met inclusion criteria; 92 were born in Latin America and 54 in China. Of those born in Latin America, 27\% received a referral for screening colonoscopy and 80\% adhered to the provider referral. Of those born in China, 24\% received a referral for colonoscopy and 92\% of those adhered to it. No significant associations were found between patient characteristics, referral for colonoscopy and completion of screening. Rates of CRC screening among Chinese and Latino patients in primary care remain low. The rate-limiting factor appears to be provider referral; language and other patient barriers play a relatively minor role.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Americans who do not have health insurance receive fewer health services and have poorer health status than those who have insurance. To better understand this disparity, in this study we characterize primary care physician’s perceptions of what effect, if any, patients’ insurance status has on their clinical decision making during office visits.
METHODS Twenty-five physician members of CAPRICORN, a primary care practice-based research network in metropolitan Washington, DC, completed a brief paper-card survey instrument immediately after each patient encounter during 2 half-day office sessions. Participants saw patients in their usual manner and were given no additional information about their patients or their insurance.
RESULTS Eighty-eight percent of participating physicians reported making at least 1 change in clinical management as a result of a patient’s insurance status. They reported altering their management during 99 of 409 patient encounters (24.2\%). There was a significant difference in the percentage of visits that involved a change in management for privately insured, publicly insured, and uninsured patients (18.7\%, 29.5\%, and 43.5\% respectively, P = .01). Physicians reported discussing insurance issues with patients during 62.6\% of visits during which they made a change in management based on insurance status.
CONCLUSION Physicians incorporate their patients’ insurance status into their clinical decision making and acknowledge they frequently alter their clinical management as a result. Additional research is needed to understand the effect of these changes on patient health and to assist both physicians and patients in enhancing the quality of care delivered within the constraints of the current insurance system.},

	abstract = {Screening for cancer is a proven and recommended approach to prevent deaths from cancer; screening can locate precursor lesions and/or cancer at early stages when it is potentially curable. Racial and ethnic minorities and other medically underserved populations exhibit lower uptake of cancer screening than nonminorities in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected minority communities, has curtailed preventive services including cancer screening to preserve personal protective equipment and prevent spread of infection. While there is evidence for a rebound from the pandemic-driven reduction in cancer screening nationally, the return may not be even across all populations, with minority population screening that was already behind becoming further behind as a result of the community ravages from COVID-19. Fear of contracting COVID-19, limited access to safety-net clinics, and personal factors like, financial, employment, and transportation issues are concerns that are intensified in medically underserved communities. Prolonged delays in cancer screening will increase cancer in the overall population from pre-COVID-19 trajectories, and elevate the cancer disparity in minority populations. Knowing the overall benefit of cancer screening versus the risk of acquiring COVID-19, utilizing at-home screening tests and keeping the COVID-19–induced delay in screening to a minimum might slow the growth of disparity.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is rarely studied in populations who may face additional barriers to participate in cancer screening, such as African American individuals and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES).To examine the associations of CRC screening and modalities with CRC incidence and mortality by race and SES.This cohort study used data from the Southern Community Cohort Study, which enrolled more than 85 000 participants from community health centers or stratified random sampling of the general population in 12 states in the southeastern United States. The present study included data from cohort members who were eligible for CRC screening as recommended by expert organizations based on age and family history. Participants completed questionnaires from 2002 to 2009 and were contacted again from 2008 to 2012. Linkages to state cancer registries and the National Death Index as of December 31, 2016, identified incident CRC and vital status. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to October 30, 2019.Incident CRC (n = 632) and mortality (n = 10 003). Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated associations between screening modalities and CRC risk and mortality. Information on fecal occult blood test use was only obtained on the follow-up questionnaire. Self-identified race was measured as African American/black, white, or other, and SES was defined by household income.This study included 47 596 participants (median baseline age, 54 years [interquartile range, 10 years]; 32 185 [67.6\%] African American; 28 884 [60.7\%] female; and 26 075 [54.8\%] with household income \&lt;\$15 000). A total of 24 432 participants (63.9\%) had never undergone CRC testing at baseline. The CRC testing assessed at baseline and follow-up interviews was associated with significant CRC risk reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95\% CI, 0.44-0.70 for ever colonoscopy at baseline). Results were similar in analyses stratified by race (African American: HR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.85; white: HR, 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.27-0.70) and household income (\&lt;\$15 000: HR, 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.46-0.86, ≥\$15 000: HR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.69). Ever sigmoidoscopy at baseline was associated with CRC risk reduction (HR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.87), and undergoing fecal occult blood test in the interval between baseline and follow-up interview was associated with CRC risk reduction (HR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.57-0.98). Inverse associations were also observed between CRC mortality and receipt of colonoscopy (HR for women, 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.21-0.73; HR for men, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.40-1.18) and sigmoidoscopy (HR for women, 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.16-0.85; HR for men, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.46-1.47); however, the association did not extend to fecal occult blood test (HR for women, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.62-1.70; HR for men, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.55-1.93).In this study, CRC test rates were low among African American individuals and those with low SES. The findings suggest that screening, particularly with colonoscopy, is significantly associated with reduced risk of CRC and mortality. The CRC disparities experienced by individuals with low SES and African American individuals may be lessened by improving access to and uptake of CRC screening.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding racial/ethnic disparities in cancer screening by family history risk could identify critical opportunities for patient and provider interventions tailored to specific racial/ethnic groups. The authors evaluated whether breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities varied by family history risk using a large, multiethnic population-based survey.
METHODS: By using the 2005 California Health Interview Survey, BC and CRC screening were evaluated separately with weighted multivariate regression analyses, and stratified by family history risk. Screening was defined for BC as mammogram within the past 2 years for women aged 40 to 64 years; for CRC, screening was defined as annual fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy within the past 5 years, or colonoscopy within the past 10 years for adults aged 50 to 64 years.
RESULTS: The authors found no significant BC screening disparities by race/ethnicity or income in the family history risk groups. Racial/ethnic disparities were more evident in CRC screening, and the Latino-white gap widened among individuals with family history risk. Among adults with a family history for CRC, the magnitude of the Latino-white difference in CRC screening (odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.60) was more substantial than that for individuals with no family history (OR, 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.59-0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of their family history widened the Latino-white gap in CRC screening among adults. More aggressive interventions that enhance the communication between Latinos and their physicians about family history and cancer risk could reduce the substantial Latino-white screening disparity in Latinos most susceptible to CRC.},

	abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes. Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5\% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4\% to 6\% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9\% to 8.2\% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5\% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17\% in 2004 to 28\% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21\% to 31\%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.},

	abstract = {Objective
To determine the association of Medicaid expansion with health insurance coverage by marital status and sex.

Methods
A population-based, quasi-experimental policy analysis was undertaken of the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion provision on or after January 1, 2014. The 2010–16 American Community Survey provided data on 3,874,432 Medicaid-eligible adults aged 19–64 with incomes up to 138\% of the federal poverty level. The outcome measures were no health insurance coverage and Medicaid coverage. The predictor variables were marital status and sex, with controls for family size, poverty status, race/ethnicity, education, employment status, immigration status, and metropolitan residence.

Results
In 2016, the uninsured rate for married men and women in a Medicaid expansion state was 21.2\% and 17.1\%, respectively, compared to 37.4\% for married men and 35.8\% for married women in a non-expansion state. The Medicaid coverage rate grew between 14.8\% to 19.3\% in Medicaid expansion states, which contrasts with less than a 5\% growth in non-expansion states. Triple differences analysis suggests that, for women of all age groups, Medicaid expansion resulted in a 1.6 percentage point lower uninsured rate for married women compared to unmarried women. For men, there was not a statistically significant difference in the uninsured rate for married compared to unmarried men. For women of all age groups, there was a 2.6 percentage point higher Medicaid coverage rate for married compared to unmarried women. For men, there was a 1.8 percentage point higher Medicaid coverage rate for married compared to unmarried men.

Conclusion
Medicaid expansion under the ACA differentially lowered uninsurance and improved Medicaid coverage for married persons, especially married women, more than unmarried persons.},

Merging two unique datasets: sum of anti-immigrant policies by state from 2005 to 2011 and a 2011 Robert Wood Johnson Center for Health Policy nationally representative sample of Latina/os (n = 1,200), we estimate a series of logistic regressions to understand how anti-immigrant legislations are affecting the health of Latina/os. Our modeling approach takes into consideration Latinos’ diverse experience, a context that is widely overlooked in datasets that treat Latina/os as a homogeneous ethnic group. Our findings suggest that an increase in anti-immigrant laws enacted by a state decreases the probability of respondents reporting optimal health, even when controlling for other relevant factors, such as citizenship status, language of interview, and interethnic variation. The implication and significance of this work has tremendous impacts for scholars, policy makers, health service providers, and applied researchers interested in reducing health disparities among minority populations.

Thus, evaluating the causal inference of strategy implementation is critical for strategists, yet few studies address practitioners’ needs in this manner. While a few studies have prioritized the need for causal inference by employing the differences-in-differences (DD) method in management research, the inherit limitations of this method pose problems for the suitability and reliability of its results. Thus, this study aims to introduce a new approach for causal inference in management research, the Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model. The BSTS analysis enables us to investigate causal inference from existing whether or not to when and how long. Using customer data from a Korean e-commerce platform, we show why BSTS can be superior to DD thereby providing a basis for subsequent use of causal inference studies delivering practical management implications.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In the United States, disparities in cancer screening, morbidity, and mortality are well documented, and often are related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic indicators including income, education, and healthcare access. Public health approaches that address social determinants of health have the greatest potential public health benefit, and can positively impact health disparities. As public health interventions, community health workers (CHWs), and patient navigators (PNs) work to address disparities and improve cancer outcomes through education, connecting patients to and navigating them through the healthcare system, supporting patient adherence to screening and diagnostic services, and providing social support and linkages to financial and community resources. Clinical settings, such as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are mandated to provide care to medically underserved communities, and thus are also valuable in the effort to address health disparities. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify studies of cancer-related CHW/PN interventions in FQHCs, and to describe the components and characteristics of those interventions in order to guide future intervention development and evaluation.

Method: We searched five databases for peer-reviewed CHW/PN intervention studies conducted in partnership with FQHCs with a focus on cancer, carried out in the United States, and published in English between January 1990 and December 2013.

Results: We identified 24 articles, all reporting positive outcomes of CHW/PNs interventions in FQHCs. CHW/PN interventions most commonly promoted breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening and/or referral for diagnostic resolution. Studies were supported largely through federal funding. Partnerships with academic institutions and community-based organizations provided support and helped develop capacity among FQHC clinic leadership and community members.

Discussion: Both the FQHC system and CHW/PNs were borne from the need to address persistent, complex health disparities among medically underserved communities. Our findings support the effectiveness of CHW/PN programs to improve completion and timeliness of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in FQHCs, and highlight intervention components useful to design and sustainability.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Under the Affordable Care Act, states were given the option to expand Medicaid in 2014. By the end of 2014, 32 states had opted to expand Medicaid and 19 did not. Previous quasi-experimental studies took advantage of this state-speciﬁc policy implementation and found increased insurance coverage in expansion compared with nonexpansion states. With longer-term data now available, we studied the effect of Medicaid expansion on changes in insurance coverage and mammography rates in expansion and nonexpansion states. STUDY DESIGN: Seven states that expanded Medicaid eligibility in 2014 and 6 nonexpansion states were selected based on available data. The US Census American Community Survey was queried for insurance coverage from 2011 to 2016 and the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2010 to 2018. Difference-in-difference linear mixed models were used to estimate and compare insurance coverage and screening mammogram rates between expansion and nonexpansion states before and after 2014.
RESULTS: The increase in insurance rates for all persons covered by some type of health insurance after Medicaid expansion was signiﬁcantly different in expansion than nonexpansion states (p ¼ 0.001). The increase in Medicaid coverage was signiﬁcant in expansion compared with nonexpansion states (p {\textless} 0.001). A similar trend was seen in screening mammogram rates in women from low-income households in expansion vs nonexpansion states (p ¼ 0.049).
CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid expansion states saw greater improvement in total insurance and Medicaid coverage, and in mammogram rates in lower-income women compared with nonexpansion states after Medicaid legislation was passed. Our study demonstrates that people do take advantage of expanded eligibility by acquiring insurance and this can improve access to preventive measures, such as screening mammography.

	abstract = {Introduction: System-level factors such as poor access to health services can help explain differential uptake in breast and cervical cancer screening between U.S.- and foreign-born women. However, few studies have explored the roles of family history and perceived risk of these cancers on screening rates. To address these gaps, this study investigates whether a family history of cancer, perceived risk, and system-level factors independently and additively predict differential screening rates of breast and cervical cancer between U.S.-born and foreign-born women living in the U.S.
Methods: Data were analyzed in 2019 from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey. Descriptive and multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to test whether there were differences in breast and cervical cancer screening within and between the 2 groups and whether family history of cancer and perceived risk of breast cancer were predictors of uptake.
Results: The sample comprised women aged 21−74 years (n=14,047). The mean age of the sample was 45.5 (SD=14.8 years). The majority of the women were U.S.-born (77.5\%). U.S.- and foreignborn women had more mammograms and Pap tests with a usual source of care (p{\textless}0.001) and insurance (p{\textless}0.001). Healthcare access and utilization factors were also predictive for both groups of women. Data analyses were conducted in 2019.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings are consistent with previous work. Access and healthcare utilization were associated with screening uptake. However, differences in risk perception, family history of breast and cervical cancers, and screening uptake were found between U.S.- and foreign-born women.},

	abstract = {Objectives To study the impact of eliminating cost sharing for screening mammography on mammography rates in a large Medicare Advantage (MA) health plan which in 2010 eliminated cost sharing in anticipation of the Affordable Care Act mandate. Study Setting Large MA health maintenance organization offering individual-subscriber MA insurance and employer-supplemented group MA insurance. Study Design We investigated the impact on breast cancer screening of a policy that eliminated a \$20 copayment for screening mammography in 2010 among 53,188 women continuously enrolled from 2007 to 2012 in an individual-subscriber MA plan, compared with 42,473 women with employer-supplemented group MA insurance in the same health maintenance organization who had full screening coverage during this period. We used differences-in-differences analysis to study the impact of cost-sharing elimination on mammography rates. Principal Findings Annual screening rates declined over time for both groups, with similar trends pre-2010 and a slower decline after 2010 among women whose copayments were eliminated. Among women aged 65–74 years in the individual-subscriber MA plan, 44.9 percent received screening in 2009 compared with 40.9 percent in 2012, while 49.5 percent of women in the employer-supplemented MA plan received screening in 2009 compared with 44.1 percent in 2012, that is, a difference-in-difference effect of 1.4 percentage points less decline in screening among women experiencing the cost-sharing elimination. Effects were concentrated among women without recent screening. There were no differences by neighborhood socioeconomic status or race/ethnicity. Conclusions Eliminating cost sharing for screening mammography was associated with modesty lower decline in screening rates among women with previously low screening adherence.},

	abstract = {Our study aimed to estimate how associations between adults’ perceptions of specific domains of PPC quality and their likelihood of receiving cancer screenings differed by race and ethnicity. We analyzed 2011–2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. Samples included 7337 women ages 50–74 (breast), 13,276 women ages 21–65 (cervical), and 9792 adults ages ≥50 years (colorectal). To examine individual domains of PPC quality (independent variables), adults reported how often providers: listened; showed respect; spent enough time; explained things; gave specific instructions; and demonstrated health literate practices (gave clear instructions and asked them to “teach-back” how they will follow instructions). Dependent variables were breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screenings. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of receiving cancer screenings using a composite measure of PPC quality and separate domains. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black adults who reported their providers always demonstrated PPC quality had higher odds of receiving colorectal cancer screenings compared to those whose providers did not. Adults’ perceptions of whether or not their provider gave them specific instructions increased their odds of receiving breast (Hispanics OR = 1.65, 95\% CI = 1.09, 2.51; non-Hispanic blacks OR = 1.54, 95\% CI = 1.06, 2.24) and colorectal (non-Hispanic whites OR = 1.37, 95\% CI = 1.13, 1.66; Hispanics OR = 1.29, 95\% CI = 1.01, 1.66; non-Hispanic blacks OR = 1.92, 95\% CI = 1.39, 2.65) cancer screenings. Non-Hispanic Asian women who reported their health care providers demonstrated “teach-back” had higher odds (OR = 2.25; 95\% CI = 1.10, 4.62) of receiving cervical cancer screenings. Efforts to improve cancer screenings should focus on training providers to demonstrate health literate practices to improve cancer screenings.},

	abstract = {Few investigations have explored the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act on health disparity outcomes in states that chose to forgo Medicaid expansion. Filling this evidence gap is pressing as Congress grapples with controversial healthcare legislation that could phase out Medicaid expansion. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a commonly diagnosed, preventable cancer in the US that disproportionately burdens African American men and has substantial potential to be impacted by improved healthcare insurance coverage. Our objective was to estimate the impact of the Affordable Care Act (increasing insurance through health exchanges alone or with Medicaid expansion) on colorectal cancer outcomes and economic costs among African American and White males in North Carolina (NC), a state that did not expand Medicaid. We used an individual-based simulation model to estimate the impact of ACA (increasing insurance through health exchanges alone or with Medicaid expansion) on three CRC outcomes (screening, stage-specific incidence, and deaths) and economic costs among African American and White males in NC who were age-eligible for screening (between ages 50 and 75) during the study period, years of 2013–2023. Health exchanges and Medicaid expansion improved simulated CRC outcomes overall, though the impact was more substantial among AAs. Relative to health exchanges alone, Medicaid expansion would prevent between 7.1 to 25.5 CRC cases and 4.1 to 16.4 per 100,000 CRC cases among AA and White males, respectively. Our findings suggest policies that expanding affordable, quality healthcare coverage could have a demonstrable, cost-saving impact while reducing cancer disparities.},

First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99\% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood have significantly better outcomes. However, less than 5\% of black children grow up in such areas. Our findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.},

The answer is politically important, but because most current research on immigration and welfare is based on data from the U.S. the answer is difficult due to the complexities of the transfer system which make eligibility determinations difficult. In Germany, by contrast, eligibility for the main cash transfer program, Sozialhilfe (Social Assistance), is determined by a comparatively simple nation-wide formula. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to test whether immigrants to Germany are more likely than natives to claim welfare benefits for which they are eligible. We find that immigrants are more likely than native Germans to receive welfare, when eligible, to claim their benefits. However, we also find that this greater propensity to take-up  benefits is not related to important status per se: When other socio-demographic factors are accounted for in an appropriate manner, immigrants households are no more likely to take up benefits than native households.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that the effects of disadvantaged neighborhoods on child educational outcomes may depend on a family’s economic resources as well as the timing of neighborhood exposures during the course of child development. However, most previous research assumes that disadvantaged neighborhoods have the same effects on all children regardless of their family resources, and few prior studies specifically analyze the timing of exposure to different neighborhood conditions across the early life course. This study extends research on neighborhood effects by investigating how timing of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods during childhood and adolescence affects high school graduation and whether these effects vary across families with different economic resources. Results based on novel counterfactual methods for time-varying treatments and time-varying effect moderators indicate that exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods, particularly during adolescence, has a strong negative effect on high school graduation, and that this deleterious effect is much more severe for children from poor families. The severe impact of spatially concentrated disadvantage on children from poor families suggests that ecological socialization models of neighborhood effects must account for the interactions between nested social contexts like the family environment and local neighborhood, as well as for the dynamic coevolution of these contexts over time.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Despite healthcare reforms mandating expanded insurance coverage and reduced out-of-pocket costs for preventive care, cancer screening rates remain relatively static. No study has measured cancer screening rates for multiple tests among non-Medicare patients.
Methods
This retrospective, population-based claims analysis, conducted in 2016–2017, of commercially insured and Medicaid-insured women aged 30–59 years enrolled in IBM MarketScan Commercial and Medicaid Databases (containing approximately 90 and 17 million enrollees, respectively) during 2010–2015 describes screening rates for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. Key outcomes were (1) proportion screened for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer among the age-eligible population compared with accepted age-based recommendations and (2) proportion with longer-than-recommended intervals between tests.
Results
One half (54.7\%) of commercially insured women aged 40–59 years (n=1,538,444) were screened three or more times during the 6-year study period for breast cancer; for Medicaid-insured women (n=78,897), the rates were lower (23.7\%). One third (43.4\%) of commercially insured and two thirds (68.9\%) of Medicaid-insured women had a {\textgreater}2.5-year gap between mammograms. Among women aged 30–59 years, 59.3\% of commercially insured women and 31.4\% of Medicaid-insured women received two or more Pap tests. The proportion of patients with a {\textgreater}3.5-year gap between Pap tests was 33.9\% (commercially insured) and 57.1\% (Medicaid-insured). Among women aged 50–59 years, 63.3\% of commercially insured women and 47.2\% of Medicaid-insured women were screened at least one time for colorectal cancer. Almost all women aged 30–59 years (commercially insured, 99.1\%; Medicaid-insured, 98.9\%) had at least one healthcare encounter.
Conclusions
Breast and cervical cancer screenings remain underutilized among both commercially insured and Medicaid-insured populations, with lower rates among the Medicaid-insured population. However, almost all women had at least one healthcare encounter, suggesting opportunities for better coordinated care.},

	abstract = {The paper evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies adopted by US states on the growth rates of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths as well as social distancing behavior measured by Google Mobility Reports, where we take into consideration people’s voluntarily behavioral response to new information of transmission risks in a causal structural model framework. Our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our main counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April and could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives. We also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 6 to 63 percent and without business closures, cases would have been larger by 17 to 78 percent. We find considerable uncertainty over the effects of school closures due to lack of cross-sectional variation; we could not robustly rule out either large or small effects. Overall, substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well. We also carry out sensitivity analyses to find neighborhoods of the models under which the results hold robustly: the results on mask policies appear to be much more robust than the results on business closures and stay-at-home orders. Finally, we stress that our study is observational and therefore should be interpreted with great caution. From a completely agnostic point of view, our findings uncover predictive effects (association) of observed policies and behavioral changes on future health outcomes, controlling for informational and other confounding variables.},

	title = {Causal inference concepts applied to three observational studies in the context of vaccine development: from theory to practice},
	abstract = {Background: Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard to evaluate causal associations, whereas assessing causality in observational studies is challenging.
Methods: We applied Hill’s Criteria, counterfactual reasoning, and causal diagrams to evaluate a potentially causal relationship between an exposure and outcome in three published observational studies: a) one burden of disease cohort study to determine the association between type 2 diabetes and herpes zoster, b) one post-authorization safety cohort study to assess the effect of AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine on the risk of autoimmune diseases, and c) one matched case-control study to evaluate the effectiveness of a rotavirus vaccine in preventing hospitalization for rotavirus gastroenteritis.
Results: Among the 9 Hill’s criteria, 8 (Strength, Consistency, Specificity, Temporality, Plausibility, Coherence, Analogy, Experiment) were considered as met for study c, 3 (Temporality, Plausibility, Coherence) for study a, and 2 (Temporary, Plausibility) for study b. For counterfactual reasoning criteria, exchangeability, the most critical assumption, could not be tested. Using these tools, we concluded that causality was very unlikely in study b, unlikely in study a, and very likely in study c. Directed acyclic graphs provided complementary visual structures that identified confounding bias and helped determine the most accurate design and analysis to assess causality.
Conclusions: Based on our assessment we found causal Hill’s criteria and counterfactual thinking valuable in determining some level of certainty about causality in observational studies. Application of causal inference frameworks should be considered in designing and interpreting observational studies.},

We report a more reliable and scalable causal discovery method (iMIIC), based on a general mutual information supremum principle, which greatly improves the precision of inferred causal relations while distinguishing genuine causes from putative and latent causal effects. We showcase iMIIC on synthetic and real-life healthcare data from 396,179 breast cancer patients from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. More than 90{\textbackslash}\% of predicted causal effects appear correct, while the remaining unexpected direct and indirect causal effects can be interpreted in terms of diagnostic procedures, therapeutic timing, patient preference or socio-economic disparity. iMIIC's unique capabilities open up new avenues to discover reliable and interpretable causal networks across a range of research fields.},

They also provide a method for critical evaluation of traditional epidemiologic criteria for confounding.

He showed that causal parameters are defined using hypothetical models that assign variation to some of the inputs determining outcomes while holding all other inputs fixed. He thus formalized and made operational Marshall's (1890) ceteris paribus analysis. We embed Haavelmo's framework into the recursive framework of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) used in one influential recent approach to causality (Pearl, 2000) and in the related literature on Bayesian nets (Lauritzen, 1996). We compare an approach based on Haavelmo's methodology with a standard approach in the causal literature of DAGs- the "do-calculus" of Pearl (2009). We discuss the limitations of DAGs and in particular of the do-calculus of Pearl in securing identification of economic models. We extend our framework to consider models for simultaneous causality, a central contribution of Haavelmo (1944). In general cases, DAGs cannot be used to analyze models for simultaneous causality, but Haavelmo's approach naturally generalizes to cover it.},

Effective analysis of such repositories often necessitate a thorough understanding of dependencies in the data. For example, if the patient age is ignored, then one might wrongly conclude a causal relationship between cataract and hypertension. Such confounding variables are often identiﬁed by causal graphs, where variables are connected by causal relationships. Current approaches to automatically building such graphs are based on text analysis over medical literature; yet, the result is typically a large graph of low precision. There are statistical methods for constructing causal graphs from observational data, but they are less suitable for dealing with a large number of covariates, which is the case in EMR data. Consequently, confounding variables are often identiﬁed by medical domain experts via a manual, expensive, and time-consuming process.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09104},
	abstract = {Learning about cause and effect is arguably the main goal in applied econometrics. In practice, the validity of these causal inferences is contingent on a number of critical assumptions regarding the type of data that has been collected and the substantive knowledge that is available. For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence (AI) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference, in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality. Second, due to their origin in AI, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the strengths of both structural econometrics as well as the potential outcomes framework, and thus offer an effective middle ground between these two literature streams.},

This article introduces a purely graphical way of characterizing endogenous selection bias and of understanding its consequences (Hernán et al. 2004). We use causal graphs (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to highlight that endogenous selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g., controlling, stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider variable, i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables, one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another that is (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection bias can result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable. We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias, common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous examples from social stratification, cultural sociology, social network analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of education.},

The availability of multiple heterogeneous datasets presents new opportunities to big data analysts, because the knowledge that can be acquired from combined data would not be possible from any individual source alone. However, the biases that emerge in heterogeneous environments require new analytical tools. Some of these biases, including confounding, sampling selection, and cross-population biases, have been addressed in isolation, largely in restricted parametric models. We here present a general, nonparametric framework for handling these biases and, ultimately, a theoretical solution to the problem of data fusion in causal inference tasks.},

	abstract = {Background:  Statistical adjustment is often considered to control confounding bias in observational studies, especially case–control studies. However, different adjustment strategies may affect the estimation of odds ratios (ORs), and in turn affect the results of their pooled analyses. Our study is aimed to investigate how to deal with the statistical adjustment in case–control studies to improve the validity of meta-analyses.
Methods:  Three types of adjustment strategies were evaluated including insufficient adjustment (not all preset confounders were adjusted), full adjustment (all confounders were adjusted under the guidance of causal inference), and improper adjustment (covariates other than confounders were adjusted). We carried out a series of Monte Carlo simulation experiments based on predesigned scenarios, and assessed the accuracy of effect estimations from metaanalyses of case–control studies by combining ORs calculated according to different adjustment strategies. Then we used the data from an empirical review to illustrate the replicability of the simulation results.
Results:  For all scenarios with different strength of causal relations, combining ORs that were comprehensively adjusted for confounders would get the most precise effect estimation. By contrast, combining ORs that were not sufficiently adjusted for confounders or improperly adjusted for mediators or colliders would easily introduce bias in causal interpretation, especially when the true effect of exposure on outcome was weak or none. The findings of the simulation experiments were further verified by the empirical research.
Conclusions:  Statistical adjustment guided by causal inference are recommended for effect estimation. Therefore, when conducting meta-analyses of case–control studies, the causal relationship formulated by exposure, outcome, and covariates should be firstly understood through a directed acyclic graph, and then reasonable original ORs could be extracted and combined by suitable methods.},

	abstract = {Overtourism is an emerging concept facing the world’s main tourist destinations. The growth that tourism has undergone in recent decades is of two diﬀerent types. On the one hand, the development of new technologies and the creation of low-cost airline carriers have increased tourism levels, leading to growth even in emerging economies. On the other hand, uncontrolled demand alongside a concentration of tourism in particular destinations impact negatively both territories and local communities. The problems caused in some destinations by the increasing, ongoing growth in tourism have created the issue of “overtourism,” which is assuming an increasing signiﬁcance in the literature. This paper contributes to the literature by providing an exploratory study with which to better understand the origins of overtourism, its implications, and predicted future perspectives in respect to the issue. Examination of the new evidence presented here contributes to the expanding knowledge of particular problems of tourism development.},

	abstract = {Background
Depression is an important public-health problem, and one of the leading causes of disease burden worldwide. Depression is often comorbid with other chronic diseases and can worsen their associated health outcomes. Few studies have explored the effect of depression, alone or as a comorbidity, on overall health status.
Methods
The WHO World Health Survey (WHS) studied adults aged 18 years and older to obtain data for health, health-related outcomes, and their determinants. Prevalence of depression in respondents based on ICD-10 criteria was estimated. Prevalence values for four chronic physical diseases—angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes—were also estimated using algorithms derived via a Diagnostic Item Probability Study. Mean health scores were constructed using factor analysis and compared across different disease states and demographic variables. The relation of these disease states to mean health scores was determined through regression modelling.
Findings
Observations were available for 245 404 participants from 60 countries in all regions of the world. Overall, 1-year prevalence for ICD-10 depressive episode alone was 3·2\% (95\% CI 3·0–3·5); for angina 4·5\% (4·3–4·8); for arthritis 4·1\% (3·8–4·3); for asthma 3·3\% (2·9–3·6); and for diabetes 2·0\% (1·8–2·2). An average of between 9·3\% and 23·0\% of participants with one or more chronic physical disease had comorbid depression. This result was significantly higher than the likelihood of having depression in the absence of a chronic physical disease (p{\textless}0·0001). After adjustment for socioeconomic factors and health conditions, depression had the largest effect on worsening mean health scores compared with the other chronic conditions. Consistently across countries and different demographic characteristics, respondents with depression comorbid with one or more chronic diseases had the worst health scores of all the disease states.
Interpretation
Depression produces the greatest decrement in health compared with the chronic diseases angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes. The comorbid state of depression incrementally worsens health compared with depression alone, with any of the chronic diseases alone, and with any combination of chronic diseases without depression. These results indicate the urgency of addressing depression as a public-health priority to reduce disease burden and disability, and to improve the overall health of populations.},

We use data from 2002 to 2010 to compare changes in receipt of mammograms and Pap tests in Massachusetts relative to other New England states. We also consider the effect specifically among low-income women. We find positive effects of Massachusetts health reform on cancer screening, suggesting a 4 to 5\% increase in mammograms and 6 to 7\% increase in Pap tests annually. Increases in both breast and cervical cancer screening are larger 3 years after the implementation of reform than in the year immediately following, suggesting that there may be an adjustment or learning period. Low-income women experience greater increases in breast and cervical cancer screening than the overall population; among women with household income less than 250\% of the federal poverty level, mammograms increase by approximately 8\% and Pap tests by 9\%. Overall, Massachusetts health reform appears to have increased breast and cervical cancer screening, particularly among low-income women. Our results suggest that reform was successful in promoting preventive care among targeted populations. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Health care office staff and providers may discriminate against people of low socioeconomic status, even in the absence of economic incentives to do so. We sought to determine whether socioeconomic status affects the response a patient receives when seeking a primary care appointment.
Methods: In a single unannounced telephone call to a random sample of family physicians and general practices (n = 375) in Toronto, Ontario, a male and a female researcher each played the role of a patient seeking a primary care physician. Callers followed a script suggesting either high (i.e., bank employee transferred to the city) or low (i.e., recipient of social assistance) socioeconomic status, and either the presence or absence of chronic health conditions (diabetes and low back pain). We randomized the characteristics of the caller for each office. Our primary outcome was whether the caller was offered an appointment.
Results: The proportion of calls resulting in an appointment being offered was significantly higher when the callers presented themselves as having high socioeconomic status than when they presented as having low socioeconomic status (22.6\% v.14.3\%, p = 0.04) and when the callers stated the presence of chronic health conditions than when they did not (23.5\% v. 12.8\%, p = 0.008). In a model adjusted for all independent variables significant at a p value of 0.10 or less (presence of chronic health conditions, time since graduation from medical school and membership in the College of Family Physicians of Canada), high socioeconomic status was associated with an odds ratio of 1.78 (95\% confidence interval 1.02–3.08) for the offer of an appointment. Socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions had independent effects on the likelihood of obtaining an appointment.
Interpretation: Within a universal health insurance system in which physician reimbursement is unaffected by patients’ socioeconomic status, people presenting themselves as having high socioeconomic status received preferential access to primary care over those presenting themselves as having low socioeconomic status.},

Identification of disparities in colorectal cancer screening will allow for targeted interventions to achieve national goals for screening. The objective of this study was to contrast colorectal cancer screening rates in urban and rural populations in the United States. The study design comprised a cross-sectional study in the United States 1998–2005. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 1998 to 2005 were the method and data source. The primary outcome was self-report up-to-date colorectal cancer screening (fecal occult blood test in last 12 months, flexible sigmoidoscopy in last 5 years, or colonoscopy in last 10 years). Geographic location (urban vs. rural) was used as independent variable. Multivariate analysis controlled for demographic and health characteristics of respondents. After adjustment for demographic and health characteristics, rural residents had lower colorectal cancer screening rates (48\%; 95\% CI 48, 49\%) as compared with urban residents (54\%, 95\% CI 53, 55\%). Remote rural residents had the lowest screening rates overall (45\%, 95\% CI 43, 46\%). From 1998 to 2005, rates of screening by colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy increased in both urban and rural populations. During the same time, rates of screening by fecal occult blood test decreased in urban populations and increased in rural populations. Persistent disparities in colorectal cancer screening affect rural populations. The types of screening tests used for colorectal cancer screening are different in rural and urban areas. Future research to reduce this disparity should focus on screening methods that are acceptable and feasible in rural areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated cost-sharing for evidence-based preventive services in an effort to encourage use.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate use of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in a national population-based sample before and after implementation of the ACA.
DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) between 2009 and 2012 comparing CRC screening rates before and after implementation of the ACA.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults 50-64 with private health insurance and adults 65-75 with Medicare.
MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported receipt of screening colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within the past year among those eligible for screening.
KEY RESULTS: Our study included 8617 adults aged 50-64 and 3761 adults aged 65-75. MEPS response rates ranged from 58 to 63\%. Among adults aged 50-64, 18.9-20.9\% received a colonoscopy in the survey year, 0.59-2.1\% received a sigmoidoscopy, and 7.9-10.4\% received an FOBT. For adults aged 65-75, 23.6-27.7\% received a colonoscopy, 1.3-3.2\% a sigmoidoscopy, and 13.5-16.4\% an FOBT. In adjusted analyses, among participants aged 50-64, there was no increase in yearly rates of colonoscopy (-0.28 percentage points, 95\% CI -2.3 to 1.7, p = 0.78), sigmoidoscopy (-1.1\%, 95\% CI -1.7 to -0.46, p = {\textless}0.001), or FOBT (-1.6\%, 95\% CI -3.2 to -0.03, p = 0.046) post-ACA. For those aged 65-75, rates of colonoscopy (+2.3\%, 95\% CI -1.4 to 6.0, p = 0.22), sigmoidoscopy (+0.34\%, 95\% CI 0.88 to 1.6, p = 0.58) and FOBT (-0.65, 95\% CI -4.1 to 2.8, p = 0.72) did not increase. Among those aged 65-75 with Medicare and no additional insurance, the use of colonoscopy rose by 12.0\% (95\% CI 3.3 to 20.8, p = 0.007). Among participants with Medicare living in poverty, colonoscopy use also increased (+5.7\%, 95\% CI 0.18 to 11.3, p = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating cost-sharing for CRC screening has not resulted in changes in the use of CRC screening services for many Americans, although use may have increased in the post-ACA period among some Medicare beneficiaries.},

We employed diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence models comparing changes in CRC screening in 20 Medicaid expansion states before and after the ACA to changes in 18 states that did not expand Medicaid during our study period. We divided the expansion period into implementation (2014) and post-expansion (2016) periods to account for possible lagged eﬀects. We observed time-varying eﬀects of Medicaid expansion that revealed relative increases in CRC screening occurring during the post-expansion period. Heterogeneous eﬀects by sex and by screening modality were also observed: there was a signiﬁcant relative increase of 16.2 percentage points (95\% CI [2.2, 30.2]; p-value = 0.023) in lifetime colonoscopy use among women in expansion states relative to non-expansion states in the post-expansion period. There were no signiﬁcant eﬀects of Medicaid expansion among men. Health insurance expansion had a lagged but signiﬁcant eﬀect on CRC screening among low-income non-elderly women in Medicaid expansion states, but no eﬀect for men. The observed increase in CRC screening among women suggests that barriers to CRC screening may diﬀer by sex, and tailored interventions to increase CRC screening improve outcomes.},

Conclusions. Major depression and factors associated with depression were more frequent among members of minority groups than among Whites. Elevated depression rates among minority individuals are largely associated with greater health burdens and lack of health insurance, factors amenable to public policy intervention.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Racial/ethnic groups comprised largely of foreign-born individuals have lower rates of cancer screening than white Americans. Little is known about whether these disparities are related primarily to their race/ethnicity or birthplace. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether foreign birthplace explains some racial/ethnic disparities in cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional study using 1998 data from the National Health Interview Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Completion of cervical, breast, or colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: Of respondents, 15\% were foreign born. In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and illness burden, black respondents were as or more likely to report cancer screening than white respondents; however, Hispanic and Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) respondents were significantly less likely to report screening for most cancers. When race/ethnicity and birthplace were considered together, U.S.-born Hispanic and AAPI respondents were as likely to report cancer screening as U.S.-born whites; however, foreign-born white (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.82), Hispanic (AOR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.79), and AAPI respondents (AOR, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.39) were less likely than U.S.-born whites to report Pap smears. Foreign-born Hispanic and AAPI respondents were also less likely to report fecal occult blood testing (FOBT); AORs, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.98; and 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.96, respectively); and sigmoidoscopy (AORs, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.51 to 0.97; and 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.40 to 0.99, respectively). Furthermore, foreign-born AAPI respondents were less likely to report mammography (AOR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.28 to 0.86). Adjusting for access to care partially attenuated disparities among foreign-born respondents. CONCLUSION: Foreign birthplace may explain some disparities previously attributed to race or ethnicity, and is an important barrier to cancer screening, even after adjustment for other factors. Increasing access to health care may improve disparities among foreign-born persons to some degree, but further study is needed to understand other barriers to screening among the foreign-born.},

Their results suggest that foreign birthplaces may explain, to some point, disparities attributed to race or ethnicity.Their idea seems unique, and they did a great job in choosing control variables with not too many or a small set of variables to reduce the bias. However, their study is not causal, and they only looked at the 1998 NHIS data. One of their results suggests that the screening rate for black was higher than for whites for all breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, which is in contrast to recent research on cancer screening disparities. I would guess that either the data or analysis has some biases. Otherwise, there should be an explanation for this significant change in black cancer screening after 20 years.
This paper could help me justify the need for controlling immigration status to evaluate disparities.},

	abstract = {Objective. 
        To systematically review all studies examining sociocultural factors influencing cervical cancer screening among immigrant and ethnic minorities in the United States along the theoretical framework of the Health Belief Model.
        Materials and Methods. 
        MEDLINE/PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, and Cochrane database searches were conducted searching for English language, US-based studies to examine minority and immigrant populations within the theoretical framework of the Health Belief Model. Fifty-five of more than 3,381 potentially relevant articles were included in the final analysis.
        Results. 
        Commonly held beliefs across several cultural groups emerged including the following: fatalistic attitudes, a lack of knowledge about cervical cancer, fear of Pap smears threatening one's virginity, as well as beliefs that a Pap smear is unnecessary unless one is ill. Beliefs unique to specific cultural groups included: body-focused notions among Hispanics, as childbirth, menses, sex, and stress were considered to play a role in one's susceptibility to cancer. African Americans identified administrative processes in establishing health care as barriers to screening, whereas Asian immigrants held a variety of misconceptions concerning one's susceptibility to cancer as well as stigmatization imposed by their own community and providers.
        Conclusion. 
        Health care providers and policy makers must be cognizant of the various sociocultural factors influencing health-related beliefs and health care utilization among immigrant and ethnic minorities in the United States. Culturally relevant screening strategies and programs that address these sociocultural factors must be developed to address the growing disparity in cervical cancer burden among underserved, resource-poor populations in the United States.},

	abstract = {Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of female cancer mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 274,000 deaths annually (Parikh, Brennan, \& Boffetta, 2003; World Health Organization, 2002). Of the estimated 500,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed each year, 80\% of these occur in developing countries, with the highest rates occurring in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America (de Sanjose et al., 2010; Ferlay et al., 2010; Lipson et al., 1995; Parikh et al., 2003; World Health Organization, 2002, 2011). Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been detected in 99\% of cervical cancer cases, and infection with HPV is a prerequisite to the development of invasive cervical cancer (de Sanjose et al., 2010; Dunne et al., 2007; Ferlay et al., 2010; Lipson et al., 1995; Parikh et al., 2003; World Health Organization, 2002, 2011). Seventy percent of cervical cancers are due to high-risk (HR) HPV types 16 and 18, and although there is some geographic variation in the prevalence of HPV, global data suggests that the eight most common high-risk oncogenic HPV genotypes (16, 18, 21, 33, 35, 45, and 52) contribute to over 90\% of the cervical cancer in all world regions [de Sanjose, 2010; Dunne, 2007; World Health Organization, 2011].},

	abstract = {Community health centers (CHCs), which serve socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, experienced an increase in insured visits after the 2014 Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage options began. Yet, little is known about how cancer screening rates changed post-ACA. Therefore, this study assessed changes in the prevalence of cervical and colorectal cancer screening from pre- to post-ACA in expansion and non-expansion states among patients seen in CHCs. Electronic health record data on 624,601 non-pregnant patients aged 21-64 eligible for cervical or colorectal cancer screening between 1/1/2012 and 12/31/2015 from 203 CHCs were analyzed. We assessed changes in prevalence and screening likelihood among patients, by insurance type and race/ethnicity and compared Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states using difference-in-difference methodology. Female patients had 19\% increased odds of receiving cervical cancer screening post- relative to pre-ACA in expansion states [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.19, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09-1.31] and 23\% increased odds in non-expansion states (aOR = 1.23, 95\% CI = 1.05-1.46): the greatest increase was among uninsured patients in expansion states (aOR = 1.36, 95\% CI = 1.16-1.59) and privately-insured patients in non-expansion states (aOR = 1.43, 95\% CI = 1.11-1.84). Colorectal cancer screening prevalence increased from 11\% to 18\% pre- to post-ACA in expansion states and from 13\% to 21\% in non-expansion states. For most outcomes, the observed changes were not significantly different between expansion and non-expansion states. Despite increased prevalences of cervical and colorectal cancer screening in both expansion and non-expansion states across all race/ethnicity groups, rates remained suboptimal for this population of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients.},

	abstract = {Background: 
        We tested whether Medicaid expansion under the Affordable care Act was associated with increased screening for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer among low-income adults.
        Methods: 
        We analyzed Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, identifying 2012 as preexpansion and 2016 as postexpansion (2014 was treated as a wash-out, and 2013 and 2015 had missing screening data from most states). States (including District of Columbia) either expanded Medicaid in 2014 (n=28) or not (n=18); five states that expanded after 2014 were excluded. Participants included low-income adults aged 18–64 without dependent children. A difference-in-difference approach tested whether expansion was significantly associated with screening, controlling for time, state effects, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and urban/rural population. For comparison, we also conducted analyses among the low-income Medicare (aged 65 and above) population, and a higher income population.
        Results: 
        There was a significant expansion effect for women aged 18–64 for cervical cancer screening (N=29,059; odds ratio, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01–1.08), and for adults 50–64 for colorectal cancer screening (N=32,290; odds ratio, 1.12; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03–1.22). Effects for mammography for women aged 40–64, or aged 50–64, were not significant. As expected, there were no significant improvements associated with expansion among the Medicare population, or among a population ineligible due to higher income.
        Conclusions: 
        Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act was associated with increased screening for cervical and colorectal cancer for low-income adults. It will be important to monitor possible adverse cancer outcomes in nonexpansion states among vulnerable populations over time.},

	abstract = {Background: There are substantial disparities in breast and cervical cancer screening that stem from lack of health insurance. Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands insurance coverage to many Americans, there are differences in availability of Medicaid coverage across states.
Purpose: To understand the potential impact of Medicaid expansions on disparities in preventive care for low-income women by assessing pre-ACA breast and cervical cancer screening across states currently expanding and not expanding Medicaid to low-income adults.
Methods: Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (analyzed in 2014) were used to consider differences in demographics among women for whom screening is recommended, including income and race/ethnicity, across expansion and nonexpansion states. Self-reported screening was compared by state expansion status overall, for the uninsured, and for low-income women. Logistic regressions were estimated to assess differences in self-reported screening across expansion and nonexpansion states controlling for demographics.
Results: Women in states that are not expanding Medicaid had signiﬁcantly lower odds of receiving recommended mammograms (OR¼0.87, 95\% CI¼0.79, 0.95) or Pap tests (OR¼0.87, 95\% CI¼0.79, 0.95). The difference was larger among the uninsured (OR¼0.72, 95\% CI¼0.56, 0.91 for mammography; OR¼0.78, 95\% CI¼0.65, 0.94 for Pap tests).
Conclusions: As women in nonexpansion states remain uninsured and others gain coverage, existing disparities in cancer screening by race and socioeconomic status are likely to widen. Health risks and associated costs to underserved populations must be taken into account in ongoing debates over expansion.

The use of DAGs can be particularly informative in the study of the causal effects of social factors on health.
Methods: The authors consider four specific scenarios in which DAGs may be useful to neighbourhood health effects researchers: (1) identifying variables that need to be adjusted for in estimating neighbourhood health effects, (2) identifying the unintended consequences of estimating ‘‘direct’’ effects by conditioning on a mediator, (3) using DAGs to understand possible sources and consequences of selection bias in neighbourhood health effects research, and (4) using DAGs to identify the consequences of adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure.
Conclusions: The authors present simplified sample DAGs for each scenario and discuss the insights that can be gleaned from the DAGs in each case and the implications these have for analytical approaches.},

	abstract = {Causal Structure Discovery (CSD) is the problem of identifying causal relationships from large quantities of data through computational methods. With the limited ability of traditional association-based computational methods to discover causal relationships, CSD methodologies are gaining popularity. The goal of the study was to systematically examine whether (i) CSD methods can discover the known causal relationships from observational clinical data and (ii) to offer guidance to accurately discover known causal relationships. We used Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a complex progressive disease, as a model because the well-established evidence provides a “gold-standard” causal graph for evaluation. We evaluated two CSD methods, Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (FGES) in their ability to discover this structure from data collected by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used structural equation models (which is not designed for CSD) as control. We applied these methods under three scenarios defined by increasing amounts of background knowledge provided to the methods. The methods were evaluated by comparing the resulting causal relationships with the “gold standard” graph that was constructed from literature. Dedicated CSD methods managed to discover graphs that nearly coincided with the gold standard. For best results, CSD algorithms should be used with longitudinal data providing as much prior knowledge as possible.},

Expanded access to health care, reduction in tobacco use, uptake of other preventive measures and cancer screening, and improved cancer therapies greatly reduced cancer mortality among women and men and underserved communities in this country. Yet, disparities in cancer outcomes remain. Underserved populations continue to experience an excessive cancer burden. This burden is largely explained by health care disparities, lifestyle factors, cultural barriers, and disparate exposures to carcinogens and pathogens, as exemplified by the COVID-19 epidemic. However, research also shows that comorbidities, social stress, ancestral and immunobiological factors, and the microbiome, may contribute to health disparities in cancer risk and survival. Recent studies revealed that comorbid conditions can induce an adverse tumor biology, leading to a more aggressive disease and decreased patient survival. In this review, we will discuss unanswered questions and new opportunities in cancer health disparity research related to comorbid chronic diseases, stress signaling, the immune response, and the microbiome, and what contribution these factors may have as causes of cancer health disparities.},

They also review programs and resources that have reduced cancer disparities and provide policy recommendations to further mitigate these inequalities. The overall cancer death rate is 19\% higher among Black males than among White males. Black females also have a 12\% higher overall cancer death rate than their White counterparts despite having an 8\% lower incidence rate. There are also substantial variations in death rates for specific cancer types and in stage at diagnosis, survival, exposure to risk factors, and receipt of preventive measures and screening by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. For example, kidney cancer death rates by sex among American Indian/Alaska Native people are ≥64\% higher than the corresponding rates in each of the other racial/ethnic groups, and the 5-year relative survival for all cancers combined is 14\% lower among residents of poorer counties than among residents of more affluent counties. Broad and equitable implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as increasing health insurance coverage through Medicaid expansion or other initiatives, could substantially reduce cancer disparities. However, progress will require not only equitable local, state, and federal policies but also broad interdisciplinary engagement to elevate and address fundamental social inequities and longstanding systemic racism.},

	abstract = {Identifying causal relationships for a treatment intervention is a fundamental problem in health sciences. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for identifying causal relationships. However, recent advancements in the theory of causal inference based on the foundations of structural causal models (SCMs) have allowed the identiﬁcation of causal relationships from observational data, under certain assumptions. Survival analysis provides standard measures, such as the hazard ratio, to quantify the eﬀects of an intervention. While hazard ratios are widely used in clinical and epidemiological studies for RCTs, a principled approach does not exist to compute hazard ratios for observational studies with SCMs. In this work, we review existing approaches to compute hazard ratios as well as their causal interpretation, if it exists. We also propose a novel approach to compute hazard ratios from observational studies using backdoor adjustment through SCMs and do-calculus. Finally, we evaluate the approach using experimental data for Ewing’s sarcoma.},

This study advances knowledge in this area by investigating the explanatory strength of such factors for cardiovascular risk screening across eight immigrant groups. Using nationally representative data from the National Health Interview Survey, we test the hypothesis that known correlates of preventive healthcare seeking differ in their ability to predict screening behavior depending on region of origin. Results show that health service factors (lack of insurance and no place for care) are fairly consistent predictors of preventive screening while socioeconomic and immigration-related factors are less so. These findings surface the complex processes underlying observed differentials in health-seeking behaviors and illuminate potential targets for public health and clinical intervention.},

It uses case studies conducted for the Urban Institute's Assessing the New Federalism project. It also uses Current Population Survey and 2000 Census data. Despite declining use of welfare nationally, immigrants and limited English speakers still comprise a significant share of people on welfare.  Immigrants compose one-third of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) California's and New York's caseload and one-fifth of Texas'. Many immigrants on welfare have significant barriers to work (lower education levels and less work history than natives). Many job training programs have English language requirements that limit access to immigrants with little English. Proposed TANF reforms increasing the number of required hours of work and limiting the types of activities that count as work will make it harder for immigrants to receive language or vocational training. Combining an emphasis on employment with opportunities for developing skills could be an especially effective model for limited English speakers. (Contains 28 references.) (SM)},

The results suggest broad-based state legislation restricting immigrant rights reduces program participation among these families.

	shorttitle = {Street-{Level} {Bureaucracy}, 30th {Anniversary} {Edition}},
	abstract = {First published in 1980, Street-Level Bureaucracy received critical acclaim for its insightful study of how public service workers, in effect, function as policy decision makers, as they wield their considerable discretion in the day-to-day implementation of public programs. Three decades later, the need to bolster the availability and effectiveness of healthcare, social services, education, and law enforcement is as urgent as ever. In this thirtieth anniversary expanded edition, Michael Lipsky revisits the territory he mapped out in the first edition to reflect on significant policy developments over the last several decades. Despite the difficulties of managing these front-line workers, he shows how street-level bureaucracies can be and regularly are brought into line with public purposes. Street-level bureaucrats—from teachers and police officers to social workers and legal-aid lawyers—interact directly with the public and so represent the frontlines of government policy. In Street-Level Bureaucracy, Lipsky argues that these relatively low-level public service employees labor under huge caseloads, ambiguous agency goals, and inadequate resources. When combined with substantial discretionary authority and the requirement to interpret policy on a case-by-case basis, the difference between government policy in theory and policy in practice can be substantial and troubling. The core dilemma of street-level bureaucrats is that they are supposed to help people or make decisions about them on the basis of individual cases, yet the structure of their jobs makes this impossible. Instead, they are forced to adopt practices such as rationing resources, screening applicants for qualities their organizations favor, "rubberstamping" applications, and routinizing client interactions by imposing the uniformities of mass processing on situations requiring human responsiveness. Occasionally, such strategies work out in favor of the client. But the cumulative effect of street-level decisions made on the basis of routines and simplifications about clients can reroute the intended direction of policy, undermining citizens' expectations of evenhanded treatment. This seminal, award-winning study tells a cautionary tale of how decisions made by overburdened workers translate into ad-hoc policy adaptations that impact peoples' lives and life opportunities. Lipsky maintains, however, that these problems are not insurmountable. Over the years, public managers have developed ways to bring street-level performance more in line with agency goals. This expanded edition of Street-Level Bureaucracy underscores that, despite its challenging nature, street-level work can be made to conform to higher expectations of public service.},

	abstract = {Take-up of Social Beneﬁts* Take-up of a social benefit is usually defined as receiving a benefit for which an individual or household is eligible. The take-up rate is the fraction of those eligible for a program who participate and receive a benefit or service. We survey estimates of take-up of social benefits around the world, discuss alternative theories of reasons for incomplete takeup, and survey the empirical evidence on the importance of different factors. We find a wide range of take-up rates around the world which follow some general patterns but are not easily explained. Theories of incomplete take-up include those involving low monetary or utility gains, stigma of receipt, monetary and nonmonetary costs of program participation, imperfect information, administrative barriers, and mismeasurement. The types of individuals who do and do not take up a program is argued to be determined by the joint distribution of gains and losses across those types, which ones face the largest administrative burden of participation and largest information deficits, and face more program operator error. There is a large body of evidence showing the importance of benefit gain and earnings losses from take-up but a smaller body of evidence on other factors, which shows that administrative barriers and costs, lack of information, and stigma all appear to be important for different programs. While there are no easy solutions to the problem of incomplete take-up, policies to at least lessen the problem are argued to be available, although generally not without increased government expenditure.},

	abstract = {Why do people buy health insurance? Conventional theory holds that people purchase insurance because they prefer the certainty of paying a small premium to the risk of getting sick and paying a large medical bill. Conventional theory also holds that any additional health care that consumers purchase because they have insurance is not worth the cost of producing it. Therefore, economists have promoted policies--copayments and managed care--to reduce consumption of this additional, seemingly low-value care.  This book presents a new theory of consumer demand for health insurance. It holds that people purchase insurance to obtain additional income when they become ill. In effect, insurance companies act to transfer insurance premiums from those who remain healthy to those who become ill. This additional income generates purchases of additional high-value care, often allowing sick persons to obtain life-saving care that they could not otherwise afford.  Regarding risk, the new theory relies on empirical studies showing that consumers actually prefer the risk of a large loss to incurring a smaller loss with certainty. Therefore, if consumers purchase insurance, it is not because they desire to avoid risk. Instead, the new theory suggests consumers simply pay a premium when healthy in exchange for a claim on additional income (effected when insurance pays for the medical care) if they become ill.  Health insurance is substantially more valuable to the consumer under the new theory. The new theory moreover implies that copayments and managed care--central health policies of the last 30 years--were directed at solving problems that largely did not exist. Because these policies either reduced the amount of income transferred to ill persons or limited access to valuable health care, they may have done more harm than good. The new theory also provides a solid theoretical justification for insuring the uninsured and for implementing national health insurance.},

However, in contrast to the income effects contained within an exogenous price decrease, these income transfers act to shift out the demand for medical care. As a result, the consumer's willingness to pay for medical care increases and the resulting additional consumption is welfare increasing.},

For citizens, this burden may occur through learning about a program; complying with rules and discretionary bureaucratic behavior to participate; and the psychological costs of participating in an unpopular program. Using a mixed-method approach, the authors explain process changes that reduced individual burden and demonstrate how this resulted in increased take-up in Medicaid in the state of Wisconsin. The findings inform the planned expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A key design principle for Medicaid and other means-tested programs is that it is possible to increase program take-up while maintaining program integrity by shifting administrative burdens from the citizen to the state.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite decades of research and interventions, significant health disparities persist. Seventeen years is the estimated time to translate scientific discoveries into public health action. This Narrative Review argues that the translation process could be accelerated if representative data were gathered and used in more innovative and efficient ways.

Methods: The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities led a multiyear visioning process to identify research opportunities designed to frame the next decade of research and actions to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. “Big data” was identified as a research opportunity and experts collaborated on a systematic vision of how to use big data both to improve the granularity of information for place-based study and to efficiently translate health disparities research into improved population health. This Narrative Review is the result of that collaboration.

Results: Big data could enhance the process of translating scientific findings into reduced health disparities by contributing information at fine spatial and temporal scales suited to interventions. In addition, big data could fill pressing needs for health care system, genomic, and social determinant data to understand mechanisms. Finally, big data could lead to appropriately personalized health care for demographic groups. Rich new resources, including social media, electronic health records, sensor information from digital devices, and crowd-sourced and citizen-collected data, have the potential to complement more traditional data from health surveys, administrative data, and investigator-initiated registries or cohorts. This Narrative Review argues for a renewed focus on translational research cycles to accomplish this continual assessment.

Conclusion: The promise of big data extends from etiology research to the evaluation of large-scale interventions and offers the opportunity to accelerate translation of health disparities studies. This data-rich world for health disparities research, however, will require continual assessment for efficacy, ethical rigor, and potential algorithmic or system bias.},

	abstract = {‘Causal inference’, in 21st century epidemiology, has notably come to stand for a
specific approach, one focused primarily on counterfactual and potential outcome reasoning
and using particular representations, such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and Bayesian
causal nets. In this essay, we suggest that in epidemiology no one causal approach should
drive the questions asked or delimit what counts as useful evidence. Robust causal
inference instead comprises a complex narrative, created by scientists appraising, from
diverse perspectives, different strands of evidence produced by myriad methods. DAGs can
of course be useful, but should not alone wag the causal tale. To make our case, we first
address key conceptual issues, after which we offer several concrete examples illustrating
how the newly favoured methods, despite their strengths, can also: (i) limit who and what
may be deemed a ‘cause’, thereby narrowing the scope of the field; and (ii) lead to
erroneous causal inference, especially if key biological and social assumptions about
parameters are poorly conceived, thereby potentially causing harm. As an alternative, we
propose that the field of epidemiology consider judicious use of the broad and flexible
framework of ‘inference to the best explanation’, an approach perhaps best developed by
Peter Lipton, a philosopher of science who frequently employed epidemiologically relevant
examples. This stance requires not only that we be open to being pluralists about both
causation and evidence but also that we rise to the challenge of forging explanations
that, in Lipton’s words, aspire to ‘scope, precision, mechanism, unification and
simplicity’.},

	abstract = {Previous literature on a variety of countries has documented a “healthy immigrant effect” (HIE). Accordingly, immigrants arriving in the host country are, on average, healthier than comparable natives. However, their health status dissipates with additional years in the country. HIE is explained through the positive self-selection of healthy immigrants as well as the positive selection, screening and discrimination applied by host countries. In this article we study the health trajectories of immigrants within the context of selection and migration policies. Using SHARE data we examine the HIE, comparing Israel and 16 European countries that have fundamentally different migration policies. Israel has virtually unrestricted open gates for Jewish people around the world, who in turn have ideological rather than economic considerations to move. European countries have selective policies with regards to the health, education and wealth of migrants, who also self-select themselves. Our results provide evidence that (1) immigrants who move to Israel have compromised health and are significantly less healthy than comparable natives. Their health disadvantage persists for up to 20 years of living in Israel, after which they become similar to natives; (2) immigrants who move to Europe have significantly better health than comparable natives. Their health advantage remains positive for many years. Even though during some time lapses they are not significantly different from natives, their health status never becomes worse than that of natives. Our results are important for migration policy and relevant for domestic health policy.},

	abstract = {The foreign-born population comprised 11.5\% of the U.S. population in 2002. Immigration to the U.S. has grown substantially and continues to grow. A close examination of the immigration data shows that immigrant community in the U.S. is not homogeneous and in fact is very diverse both within itself and from the native-born population. U.S. Census Bureau data reveal that these differences create pockets of divergent populations within the country. How these populations assimilate into the U.S. healthcare system is not clearly understood. Cultural values, beliefs, and practices often juxtapose the immigrant to the healthcare system. Religious differences coupled with educational and income disparities add to the challenge of developing and implementing healthcare programs. This paper concludes with suggestions for more research in healthcare to immigrants.},

	abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that immigrants to Canada experience deterioration in their health status after settling in the country. While self-selection processes and Canadian immigration policy ensure that, at the time of arrival, immigrants are healthier than the Canadian-born population, this health advantage does not persist over time. This study uses new data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (N=7720) to examine how health transitions vary among immigrants. Logistic regression analyses indicate that visible minorities and immigrants who experienced discrimination or unfair treatment are most likely to experience a decline in self-reported health status. The results also confirm a clear inverse socioeconomic gradient with respect to increasing levels of feelings of sadness, depression and loneliness. These findings reflect important dimensions driving population health patterns in Canada, a country with a highly lauded health care system based on the principles of universality and comprehensiveness. Our findings suggest that discrimination and inequality partly drive the health transitions of immigrants. These factors, which largely operate outside of the formal health care system, need to be understood and addressed if health inequities are to be reduced.},

	abstract = {The health status of people is a precious commodity and central to economic, socio-political, and environmental dimensions of any country. Yet it is often the missing statistic in all general statistics, demographics, and presentations about the portrait of immigrants and natives. In this paper we are concerned with international migration and health outcomes in the host countries. Through a general literature review and examination of specific immigration countries, we provide insights into the Healthy Immigrant Paradox and the health assimilation of immigrants as we also elucidate selection and measurement challenges. While health is part of human capital, health assimilation is the mirror image of earnings assimilation. Namely, immigrants arrive with better health compared to natives and their health deteriorates with longer residence in the host country, converging to the health of natives or becoming even worse. A deeper understanding of immigrant health trajectories, and disparities with natives and other immigrants is of great value to societies and policymakers, who can design appropriate policy frameworks that address public health challenges, and prevent the health deterioration of immigrants.},

	abstract = {Studies show that there is a healthy immigrant effect; persons who choose to migrate have better health than the native population, but there is a deterioration of health status the longer they reside in the host country. Therefore is migration bad for migrants’ health? Despite having studied numerous variables, such as age, level of studies, civil status, number of family members, number of years in the host country, language proficiency, and discrimination, that are involved in migrants' health, a gender perspective is notably absent from this body of research. As in the general population, migrant women have worse health than migrant men. When it comes to the phenomenon of migration, gender is present throughout the process from the decision to migrate, during migration, and, subsequently, in the country of destination, because women and men do not perform the same jobs in the host countries. Therefore gender-related issues need to be accounted for in order to explain the health differences between men and women, and in this chapter we will analyze the healthy immigrant effect from a gender perspective, because it is not very common to do so. Working conditions, social support, and socioeconomic status affect men and women differently, and they involve different gender inequalities. Furthermore, migrants face different barriers throughout their health care process. Finally, because migration is a very complex phenomenon and because of the increasing inequities within the category of women and men, we analyze the need to introduce an intersectional approach in studying migrants' health.},
